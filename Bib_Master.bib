  Abstract                 = {Collisions of cars with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were studied in southern Michigan in 1966 and 1967. Most of the 2,566 accidents studied occurred at dawn, dusk, or after dark with peaks at sunrise and 2 hours after sunset. Accidents were highest on weekends when evening traffic was greatest. A low seasonal peak in collisions occurred in May and a high one in November. Sex ratio of the annual kill was predominately female, but it shifted in favor of males during seasonal peaks. Causes of the peaks seemed to be primarily rutting activities, with hunter disturbance and food of lesser importance. Accidents were related to habitat type approximately according to the prevalence of the type. Accidents were most common at speeds of 80-95 km/h (50-59 mph), and the deer was killed in 92 percent of the accidents. Human injuries occurred in less than 4 percent, and most resulted from secondary collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed how the application of scent-marking, forest clearing, and supplemental feeding correlated with the number of moose (Alces alces)–train collisions along the most vulnerable railroad stretch in Norway. Data on 1,045 collisions has been compiled for 18 years since 1985, and remedial actions have occurred during various periods since 1990. We used sections of the rail line where remedies had never been applied as control sections to estimate the expected number of collisions per year and per km. In this way, we took into account the yearly vari- ation in the number of accidents by using the difference between the actual number of accidents and the expect- ed number of accidents as our response variable. We compared the difference between periods when remedies were applied to periods without any remedy. We found a general 46\% decrease in the number of accidents during years with a remedy compared to what would have been expected the same years without any remedy. Forest clear- ing and supplemental feeding seem to be reliable ways of reducing the number of collisions. Scent was only applied for short distances in a few years, and the beneficial effects we observed were questionable. We conclude that mit- igative efforts may substantially reduce accidental mortality in moose populations if applied for long distances. We discuss the economics of game-vehicle collisions by performing a simple calculation to visualize the need for a bio- economic approach to the problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, are thought to respond to high risks of predation by foraging closer to refuge and by forming larger groups, but females with newly emergent offspring mostly forage alone, a response thought to reduce predation risk on the latter. I tested these hypotheses for wild kangaroo populations in southeastern Australia, using a field-based experimental reduction of a potential predator, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. I monitored kangaroo foraging behaviour in two fox removal and two control sites by counting scats at 30 and 150 m from refuge during September 1994 and 1995 (after 5 and 16 months of fox control). I also monitored kangaroo group sizes in all sites, using monthly or bimonthly direct observations over 22 months of fox reduction. In both years, fox removal caused kangaroos to deposit relatively more scats further from refuge than in control sites where fox numbers were more than 85\% higher. This suggests strongly that kangaroos spend more time foraging close to refuge when predation risk is high. Group sizes were also smaller in fox removal sites although only during June–October when the majority of females had large pouch young. In November–March, group size decreased in all sites owing to the solitary behaviour of many females with young at foot. However, where foxes were removed, the mean group size of such females was smaller than in control sites and females were also more often alone where foxes were removed. These results suggest that solitary behaviour increases rather than decreases predation risk. This experiment highlights that grouping behaviour is risk sensitive and that some individuals accept higher risks of predation to mitigate other costs of group foraging.},

  Abstract                 = {Tracking techniques were used along US 2 and NH 115 in the towns of Jefferson and Randolph, NH to record geo-referenced wildlife highway-crossing data for GIS-based analysis. Over 7000 track sets from 22 species were recorded from December 2005 through May 2006. Moose, red fox, white-tailed deer, and coyotes left most tracks. A substantial number of fisher and bobcat were also recorded. This data set is unique in size and the number of carnivores recorded. Analyses completed for this report indicate that variations in landscape scale habitat composition in the study area were correlated with variations in wildlife crossing rates at the landscape scale. Different species also showed different affinities for the roadside at this scale. At the local scale, the rate of moose crossing was higher in locations with mixed forest cover types and where guardrails end, but not in locations with high moose/vehicle collision rates. Crossing by predators, excluding red fox, increased with the presence of coniferous cover types, and the rate of deer crossing increased with the presence of open cover types. Additional analyses at the roadside scale will be conducted and results will be available at a later date.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most obvious impacts of roads on wildlife is vehicle-induced mortality. The aims of this study were to examine the spatial pattern of mammal–vehicle collisions (MVCs), identify and examine factors that contribute to MVCs, and determine whether the factors that increase the odds of MVCs are similar between species. On 103 road surveys that covered 7,094 total km I recorded the location of each MVC along the survey route. I measured landscape and roadway features associated with each MVC and used kernel density and network analysis tools to identify road mortality hotspots and measure spatial clustering of MVCs. I used logistic regression to model the likelihood of MVCs for all mammal data and separately for Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), Raccoon (Procyon lotor), Skunk (Mephitis mephitis), Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) and Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) data sets. I identified 51 MVC hotspots and found spatial clustering of MVCs for Porcupines, Raccoons and Skunks. Two landscape variables, distance to cover and the presence of an ecotone, as well as one road variable, road width, appeared as broadly important predictors of mammalian road mortality, though there was also species- specific variation in factors that increased the risk of MVCs. Field-measured variables were more important than remotely-measured variables in predicting the odds of MVCs. Con- servation implications are that mitigation of landscape features associated with higher risk of vehicle-collisions may reduce the number of MVCs in general, but species-specific research is required to more carefully tailor mitigation efforts for particular species.},

  Abstract                 = {Collisions between wildlife and vehicles represent a large source of mortality for many species. To implement effective protection zones, it is important to identify areas in which wildlife–vehicle collisions are likely to occur. We used statistical models to derive an index of risk of co-occurrence between manatees and boats. Our statistical models were used to predict the distribution of both manatees and boats, while accounting for observer-specific detection probabilities. Models used aerial survey data and we found that both environmental and temporal covariates influenced manatee and boat distributions. Moreover, the probability of detecting manatees varied substantially with the weather and among observers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that manatee distribution is modeled as a function of key environmental and seasonal covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection of manatees. We computed an index of risk of co-occurrence by multiplying the probability of manatee occupancy by the expected boat density and occupancy to identify areas where manatee–boat collisions are likely to occur. This analytical framework emphasizes the importance of accounting for imperfect detection, and how modeling distribution of both organisms and vehicles as a function of key covariates can help improve predictions of risk of collisions. Risk of collision metrics can then be used in designing protection zones.},

  Abstract                 = {Risk assessments can be used to identify threats, which vary both in space and time, to declining species. Just as hot spots describe locations where threat processes operate at a higher rate than in surrounding areas, hot moments refer to periods when threat rates are highest. However, the identification of hot moments can be challenging because the temporal complexity of some threat processes makes their effects on population viability difficult to predict. Declining throughout much of their range, Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) populations are potentially most vulnerable to road mortality where road densities and traffic volumes are high. The temporal variations in road-mortality risk faced by these and other semiaquatic turtles at the population level are a consequence of several factors, including sex-specific movement characteristics and seasonal changes in traffic volume. We examined these risk factors for Blanding's turtle populations in Maine, USA, by integrating temporally explicit roadkill probabilities with demographic parameters informed by local and range-wide studies. Specifically, we used population simulations to estimate the relative risk for 14 2-week periods during the turtles' active season. Our analysis clearly identified early summer as a period of elevated risk, with June through mid-July signaling a road-mortality hot moment for Blanding's turtles (for both M and F). These findings provide guidance for the implementation of temporally explicit conservation measures such as cautionary road signage, traffic management, and public outreach that, if timed strategically, could help to mitigate population impacts from road mortality.},

Yet, annual average daily traffic flow (AADT) and posted speed limit (PSL) typically are used to measure these variables. To resolve this conflict, we studied the effects of traffic volume and vehicle speed on DVCs in Utah. Our results showed no relationship between AADT or PSL and DVC occurrence. There are at least 3 explanations for our results: (1) no causal relationship exists; (2) AADT and PSL, as measured, actually explain little of the variation; and (3) data quality problems exist. We discuss the likelihood for each explanation. We argue that even though traffic speed and volume have been used to predict DVC occurrence and may be useful explanatory variables, the metrics AADT and PSL are poor surrogate variables. Thus, uses of these variables to predict risk will likely provide unreliable results.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the impacts of roads on wildlife and the natural environment is of increasing importance. Macropods (mostly kangaroos and wallabies) are a diverse and widespread taxon in Australia that has been significantly affected by the presence of roads in various ways. We reviewed the available literature on macropods and roads, assessing 60 scientific journal articles, reports and theses. Studies on road mortalities were the most prevalent (n = 29, with 12 on macropods only), revealing both spatial and temporal patterns in occurrence. Behavioural studies in relation to the road environment are limited (n = 2) yet could help our understanding of patterns of road-kill and other impacts. Some macropod populations are critically affected by the presence of roads (e.g. brush-tailed rock-wallaby, Petrogale penicillata) due to either proportionately high road mortalities and/or population fragmentation, and may face continued decline unless effective road-mitigation measures are implemented. Investigations of various types of road mitigation focussed on wildlife-exclusion fencing and road crossing structures as the most effective option, although the high cost of these measures appears to limit their implementation. Further research into several areas was identified, particularly on species where severe road impacts are likely to result in population declines.},

  Abstract                 = {Wildlife warning signs are the most commonly used and widespread form of road impact mitigation, aimed at reducing the incidence of wildlife–vehicle collisions. Evidence of the effectiveness of currently used signs is rare and often indicates minimal change in driver behaviour. Improving the design of these signs to increase the likelihood of appropriate driver response has the potential to reduce the incidence of wildlife–vehicle collisions. This study aimed to examine and assess the opinions of drivers on wildlife warning sign designs through a public opinion survey. Three currently used sign designs and five alternative sign designs were compared in the survey. A total of 134 drivers were surveyed. The presence of temporal specifications and an updated count of road-killed animals on wildlife warning signs were assessed, as well as the position of the sign. Drivers’ responses to the eight signs were scaled separately at three speed limits and participants indicated the sign to which they were most likely to respond. Three signs consistently ranked high. The messages conveyed by these signs and their prominent features were explored. Animal-activated and vehicle speed-activated signs were ranked very highly by participants. Extensive field trials of various sign designs are needed to further this research into optimizing wildlife warning sign designs.},

Eleven mammal and 14 bird species were recorded, but Australian possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) predominated, and pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio), mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) were the most common birds. Counts of possums, hedgehogs and rabbits ranged between 0.7 and 89 corpses/100 km, and changed dramatically over six decades. The possum count rose 80% between 1984 and 1994, but declined 60% by 2005. A possible irruption of hedgehogs is reported in 1988–89, followed by an 82% decline in their numbers between 1994 and 2005. Although rabbit hemorrhagic disease was introduced to New Zealand in 1997, rabbit road-kill increased 59% between 1994 and 2005. The relationship between road-kill and traffic volume indicates that roads carrying more than 3000 vehicles per day act as bar- riers to larger mammals, while vehicles on less busy roads are more dangerous for crossing animals. We suggest that regular counts taken at annual intervals over the same roads is a useful method for gathering information about the changing distribution and rela- tive abundance of certain animals on a provincial or national scale and over long periods of time. Regular counts at seasonal, monthly or weekly intervals are also a rich source of information.},

  Abstract                 = {Traffic volume is a fundamental variable in several transportation engineering applications. For instance, in transportation planning, the annual average daily traffic (AADT) is a primary element that has to be estimated for the year of horizon of the analysis. The huge amounts of money to be invested in designed transportation systems are strongly associated with the traffic volumes expected in the system, which means that it is important that the AADT should be accurately predicted. In this paper, a modified version of a pattern recognition technique known as support vector machine for regression (SVR) to forecast AADT is presented. The proposed method- ology computes the SVR prediction parameters based on the distribution of the training data. Therefore, the proposed method is called SVR with data-dependent parameters (SVR-DP). Using 20 years of AADT for both rural and urban roads in 25 counties in the state of Tennessee, the performance of the SVR-DP was compared with those of Holt exponential smoothing (Holt-ES) and of ordinary least- square linear regression (OLS-regression). SVR-DP performed better than both methods; although the Holt-ES also presented good results.},

This suggests that the mean group size may be a useful index to density. The red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) and the grey kangaroo (Macropus canguru) have similar mean daily schedules of activity and rest, but grey kangaroos visit water about 3 times as often as reds, the latter species being better adapted to desert and semidesert conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying factors that contribute to the risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) has been a key focus of wildlife managers, transportation safety planners and road ecologists for over three decades. Despite these efforts, few generalities have emerged which can help predict the occurrence of WVCs, heightening the uncertainty under which conservation, wildlife and transportation management decisions are made. Undermining this general understanding is the use of study area boundaries that are incongruent with major biophysical gradients, inconsistent data collection protocols among study areas and species-specific interactions with roads. We tested the extent to which factors predicting the occurrence of deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) were general among five study areas distributed over a 11,400-km 2 region in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. In spite of our system-wide focus on the same genus (i.e., Odocoileus hemionus and O. virginianus), study area delineation along major biophysical gradients, and use of consistent data collection protocols, we found that large-scale biophysical processes influence the effect of localized factors. At the local scale, factors predicting WVC occurrence varied greatly between individual study areas. Distance to water was an important predictor of WVCs in three of the five study areas, while other variables had modest importance in only two of the five study areas. Thus, lack of generality in factors predicting WVCs may have less to do with methodological or taxonomic differences among study areas than the large-scale, biophysical context within which the data were collected. These results highlight the critical need to develop a conceptual framework in road ecology that can unify the disparate results emerging from field studies on WVC occurrence.},

We surveyed roads varying in traffic volume, configuration and adjacent landscape attributes for road-kills between 1997 and 2000. The spatial pattern of road-kills was described using neighbour K statistics. We investigated the importance of road-kills at three taxonomic levels using logistic regression. Mammal and bird road-kill indices were consistently higher on a low volume parkway than on the high-speed, high volume Trans-Canada highway (TCH). Birds were more vulnerable to collisions than mammals on the TCH. Road-kill aggregations were nonrandomly distributed. Parkway road-kills were aggregated on small scales and characterized by low clustering intensities compared to the TCH. Road-kills were less likely to occur on raised sections of road. Road-kills tended to occur close to vegetative cover and far from wildlife passages or culverts. Our findings reveal how two distinct road types can have different effects in terms of vertebrate mortality and their spatial pattern. We recommend a series of mitigation measures for existing roads or future road planning projects.},

  Abstract                 = {Decision-making in the design of effective wildlife passage structures is hampered by the sparse information currently available. There are several reasons for this deficiency. Monitoring wildlife passages is not often anticipated after construction. There are few methodological approaches to identify the placement of wildlife passages. Finally, there is an urgent need for mitigation procedures that contemplate the broad landscape context of road systems. When used in a geographic information system (GIS) environment, regional or landscape level connectivity models of sufficient resolution can help delineate placement of wildlife crossing structures. GIS tools and applications are becoming more popular among resource managers and transportation planners. An empirically based habitat linkage model is preferred to qualitative or conceptual models based on limited data. However, in many cases, the data necessary for empirically based models are not available. As a substitute, expert information can be used to develop simple, predictive, habitat linkage models in a relatively short period of time. Banff National Park is preparing for a new Trans-Canada highway (TCH) expansion and mitigation project. We need to be able to provide park managers with an empirical assessment of the impediments posed by transportation corridors to animal movements, and recommend the placement of mitigation measures. For some species there are empirical data, while for others there are little or no data. Given this situation, we developed several GIS approaches to model animal movements across transportation corridors in the Central Rocky Mountains. For a single species, we developed three different but spatially explicit habitat models to identify linkage areas across the TCH. One model was based on empirical data, and the other two models were based on expert opinion and expert literature. We used the empirical model as a yardstick to measure the accuracy of the expert-based models. Our tests showed the expert literature- based model most closely approximated the empirical model, both in the results of statistical tests and the description of the linkages. For a similar exercise using empirical data, we developed a multi-scale GIS approach to model multiple species movements across the TCH and identify mitigation passage placement. Three steps were involved: 1) the creation of regional habitat suitability models for each of four large mammal species, 2) the development of a regional scale movement component to the models, and (3) nested within step 2, the construction of local-scale movement models of high spatial resolution within the transportation corridor. Recommendations regarding the location of potential mitigation based on the intersection of simulated pathways with transportation corridors and other human infrastructure were the result of the exercise. Our empirical and expert models represent useful tools for resource and transportation planners charged with determining the location of mitigation passages. Expert models were shown to be practical when baseline information is lacking and time constraints do not allow for pre-construction data collection. It is important to note the wide applicability of such models to other planning issues in the Central Rocky Mountains. The proposed models could be applied to other human infrastructure, such as railways, trails, or other road systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Roadkill is one of the most prominent causes of wildlife mortality. Much research effort has focussed on collisions with ungulates because of traffic safety. However, studies about large carnivore roadkills are scarce despite vehicles being a main cause of mortality. The absence of studies can be explained in part because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient sample sizes. We collected data from locations of 82 wolf roadkill sites in the Castilla y León Region, northwest Spain. We evaluated different models to characterise collision localities using logistic regressions with corrections for rare events. The best models included traffic and human disturbance parameters. Landscape variables did not improve predictive power. Fencing was a decisive key predictor; roadkill was proportionally higher along fenced highways than on similar major roads that lacked fences. Wolf–vehicle collisions were more common in agricultural areas, although wolf densities were lower in these zones. Both the higher density of important roads and a greater proportion of roaming wolves on the plateau may explain this pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1964, Graeme Caughley published two papers on the activity, density, dispersion and social organisation of kangaroos. He made direct observations of the behaviour of two species, and used measures of their faecal pellets to infer habitat use. This work paved the way for many studies of the behaviour of individual kangaroos, the associations between them, and the dispersion of individuals within a population. At an individual level, activity budgets of kangaroos are now known to be influenced by extrinsic factors such as weather, season, and forage conditions, as well as intrinsic factors such as sex and reproductive status. Habitat selection is understood in terms of the requirement for both food and horizontal cover, and past predation continues to play a role in the use of cover, as Caughley first proposed. At the level of associations among individuals, group size is positively related to population density, as Caughley predicted, but is also influenced by habitat structure. Contrary to his views, the high rate of group flux does not represent random movement of individuals. Instead, there are subtle yet persistent associations between related individuals. There is also strong dissociation between population classes when sexual segregation occurs during the non-mating period in seasonally breeding populations. Despite these effects, kangaroos are only weakly constrained by social factors, suggesting that population dispersion may conform to ideal free distribution when food resources are limited. At a management level, this suggests that kangaroos have the potential to redistribute rapidly after culling programs aimed at reducing density in overabundant populations.},

There was a significant bias towards males in five species, ranging from 65 to 92\% males, but there was no difference from parity in the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus. Male eastern grey kangaroos, M. giganteus, and male western grey kangaroos, M. fuliginosus, probably behave in ways that expose them to vehicles more than females. Male-biased road-kills of swamp wallabies, Wallabia bicolor, may reflect skewed population sex ratios. There are insufficient data on the behaviour and population structure of the red-necked wallaby, M. rufogriseus, and rufous-bellied pademelon, Thylogale billardierii, to determine which explanation is responsible for male-biased road mortality in these species.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the fact that all highways in Hungary are built with fencing, there are still 5 \% of traffic accidents that involve wildlife. Therefore, this study focused on the incidence of collisions along fenced roads. Wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) hotspots were mapped, and the spatial frequencies were analysed with Poisson regression. In general, most WVCs and almost all of the roe deer fatalities occurred at highway intersections, or at interchanges. Red fox casualties also occurred at interchanges as well as at passages. Wild boar fatalities were not particularly frequent at interchanges but were recorded near railways that are parallel to highways; otter-vehicle collision hotspots were found near their habitats and migration corridors such as streams. For otter, badger and wild boar, we were able to examine the role of local population density; most WVCs happened in areas of high population density. The badger model predicted that badger kills were more likely where the fence was not buried in the soil. Most WVCs occur at interchanges because wildlife enters the right-of-way (ROW) at fence ends; or it enters at a fence gap and runs along the outside of fence and becomes funnelled onto the ROW at the interchanges. Interruption in the continuity and linearity are important factors in both cases. We concluded that the number of WVCs can be reduced significantly if animals were prevented from entering highway interchanges and proposals for mitigation were made. We also propose a tool to assist in alleviating WVCs, by mapping them in Google Maps and integrating hotspots into a car navigation system.},

However, in the past 30–40 years it has moved into more arid regions (rainfall<250 mm), thus increasing its overlap zone with the xeric adapted Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus).

The water use, drinking patterns and thermoregulatory behaviour of these two species of kangaroo have been examined in a semi-free range study, during summer at an arid range- land site. Foraging was largely nocturnal in both species and during the day they behaved to reduce heat loads. This was especially so for M. giganteus, which showed greater shade seeking. However, it still used more water than M. rufus and drank twice as frequently. Although M. giganteus produced a less concentrated urine than M. rufus, kidney physiology did not explain all of the differences in water metabolism be- tween the species. Water from the feed and faecal water retention also appear to be involved. Broadly, a better access to reliable water and the utilisation of mesic mi- crohabitats has enabled M. giganteus to make inroads into the changing rangelands of eastern Australia.

  Abstract                 = {Kangaroos may be the strangest of mammals - not so much because they keep their babies in pouches and lok like a cross between a giant rat and a deer - but because they alone among the large vertebrates can hop. This appealing natural history by an internationally known expert is the only up-to-date book on these unique animals. Illustrating his account with color photos and black-and-white drawings, Terence J. Dawson makes recent research on the biology, locomotion, behavior, and ecology of large kangaroos accessible to readers from tourists to specialists.The six species and four subspecies of red and gray kangaroos occupy habitats across most of Australia, and are distinguished mainly by size from their smaller relatives the wallabies. The largest marsupials, kangaroos belong to the Superfamily Macropodoidae, or "big foots", and are further characterized by complex stomachs and specialized teeth for grazing.Dawson considers the evolution of kangaroos, as well as their energetics, grazing habits, and classification. For each species, he details social organization, habitat, patterns of activity, population structure, reproductive biology and bheavior, feeding characteristics, and environmental physiology. The author documents as well the uneven history of coexistence between kangaroos and their human neighbors - both aboriginal and European. In addition to comparing cultural attitudes towards kangaroos, he explores such issues as hunting habits, conservation efforts, the problem of kangaroos as agricultural pests, and the economics of kangaroo ranching.},

  Abstract                 = {The avoidance of motorized vehicles is a common challenge for birds in the modern world. Birds appear to rely on antipredator behaviors to avoid vehicles, but modern vehicles (automobiles and aircraft) are faster than natural predators. Thus, birds may be relatively ill-equipped, in terms of sensory capabilities and behaviors, to avoid vehicles. We examined the idea that birds may be unable to accurately assess particularly high speeds of approaching vehicles, which could contribute to miscalculations in avoidance behaviors and ultimately cause collisions. We baited turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) to roads with animal carcasses and measured flight initiation distance and effective time-to-collision in response to a truck driving directly towards vultures from a starting distance of 1.13 km and at one of three speeds: 30, 60, or 90 kph (no vultures were struck). Flight initiation distance of vultures increased by a factor of 1.85 as speed increased from 30 to 90 kph. However, for 90-kph approaches there was no clear trend in flight initiation distance across replicates: birds appeared equally likely to initiate escape behavior at 40 m as at 220 m. Time-to-collision decreased by a factor of 0.62 with approach speeds from 30 to 90 kph. Also, at 90 kph, four vehicle approaches (17%) resulted in near collisions with vultures (time-to- collision #1.7 s), compared to none during 60 kph approaches and one during 30 kph approaches (4%). Our findings suggest that antipredator behaviors in turkey vultures, particularly stimulus processing and response, might not be well tuned to vehicles approaching at speeds $90 kph. The possible inability of turkey vultures to react appropriately to high- speed vehicles could be common among birds, and might represent an important determinant of bird-vehicle collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on the application of the principle of demographic gravitation to estimate link-level annual average daily traffic (AADT) based on land-use characteristics. According to the principle, the effect of a variable on AADT of a link decreases with an increase in distance from the link. The spatial variations in land-use characteristics were captured and integrated for each study link using the principle of demographic gravitation. The captured land-use characteristics and on-network characteristics were used as independent variables. Traffic count data available from the permanent count stations in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, were used as the dependent variable to develop statistical and neural network models. Negative binomial count statistical models (with log-link) were developed as data were observed to be over-dispersed while neural network models were developed based on a multilayered, feed-forward, back-propagation design for supervised learning. The results obtained indicate that statistical and neural network models ensured significantly lower errors when compared to outputs from traditional four-step method used by regional modelers. Overall, the neural network model yielded better results in estimating AADT than any other approach considered in this research. The neural network approach can be particularly suitable for their better predictive capability, whereas the statistical models could be used for mathematical formulation or understanding the role of explanatory variables in estimating AADT.},

  Abstract                 = {Deer-vehicle accidents are an increasing problem in many regions of the world. To elaborate effective mitigation measures, it is necessary to determine envi- ronmental factors associated with the occurrence of such accidents. The Lauren­ tides Wildlife Reserve in Quebec, Canada, is a prime example of an area hav- ing a long-lasting problem of moose-vehicle accidents (MVAs). We tested the effect of the spatial and temporal variables most likely to influence MVAs in this area based on accidents recorded over a 13-year period. Data collected in­­ cluded the date and time of each collision as well as the position of the accident relative to the closest 1-km road marker. We calculated 10 variables to assess moose habitat suitability, moose density, topography and road design for every 1-km road segment. There was a total of 754 MVAs during 1990-2002. The period with the highest number of accidents was the second half of June but accident frequency remained relatively high from mid-May to late August. The risk of accident per vehicle was at least 2-3 times higher at night (when traffic volume was lowest) than during any other time of the day. Also, MVAs were over 42% more frequent on Fridays, when road traffic levels were highest. The prob- ability of an MVA increased when air temperature and atmospheric pressure were high. The MVA rate increased with moose density, in the presence of at least one brackish pool (by 80%) and when a valley traversed the road (by 120%). Implications of our results in the choice of appropriate mitigation mea- sures are discussed. Future work should aim to describe habitat characteristics at the actual collision site.},

  Abstract                 = {Carcass searches are a common method for studying the risk of anthropogenic hazards to wildlife, including nontarget poisoning and collisions with anthropogenic structures. Typically, numbers of carcasses found must be corrected for scavenging rates and imperfect detection. Parameters for these processes (scavenging and detection) are often estimated using carcass distribution trials in which researchers place carcasses in the field at known times and locations. In this manuscript I develop a variety of estimators based on multi-event or hidden Markov models for use under different experimental conditions. I apply the estimators to two case studies of avian mortality, one from pesticide exposure and another at wind turbines. The proposed framework for mortality estimation points to a unified framework for estimation of scavenging rates and searcher efficiency in a single trial and also allows estimation based only on accidental kills, obviating the need for carcass distribution trials. Results of the case studies show wide variation in the performance of different estimators, but even wider confidence intervals around estimates of the numbers of animals killed, which are the direct result of small sample size in the carcass distribution trials employed. These results also highlight the importance of a well-formed hypothesis about the temporal nature of mortality at the focal hazard under study.},

  Abstract                 = {We attempted a complete review of the empirical literature on effects of roads and traffic on animal abundance and distribution. We found 79 studies, with results for 131 species and 30 species groups. Overall, the number of documented negative effects of roads on animal abundance outnumbered the number of positive effects by a factor of 5; 114 responses were negative, 22 were positive, and 56 showed no effect. Amphibians and reptiles tended to show negative effects. Birds showed mainly negative or no effects, with a few positive effects for some small birds and for vultures. Small mammals generally showed either positive effects or no effect, mid-sized mammals showed either negative effects or no effect, and large mammals showed predominantly negative effects. We synthesized this information, along with information on species attributes, to develop a set of predictions of the conditions that lead to negative or positive effects or no effect of roads on animal abundance. Four species types are predicted to respond negatively to roads: (i) species that are attracted to roads and are unable to avoid individual cars; (ii) species with large movement ranges, low reproductive rates, and low natural densities; and (iii and iv) small animals whose populations are not limited by road-affected predators and either (a) avoid habitat near roads due to traffic disturbance or (b) show no avoidance of roads or traffic disturbance and are unable to avoid oncoming cars. Two species types are predicted to respond positively to roads: (i) species that are attracted to roads for an important resource (e. g., food) and are able to avoid oncoming cars, and (ii) species that do not avoid traffic disturbance but do avoid roads, and whose main predators show negative population-level responses to roads. Other conditions lead to weak or non-existent effects of roads and traffic on animal abundance. We identify areas where further research is needed, but we also argue that the evidence for population-level effects of roads and traffic is already strong enough to merit routine consideration of mitigation of these effects in all road construction and maintenance projects.},

As mitigation tools, predictive models of roadkill are becoming more common in the published literature; however, few models generalize across multiple taxa, and thus are less useful for management scenarios that account for multiple target species. Using a dataset of 653 vertebrate roadkills collected from 2 parks in southern Ontario, we constructed generalized linear mixed models to determine the simultaneous risk factors for bird, frog, mammal, five-lined skink ( Eumeces fasciatus), snake, toad, and turtle hatchling roadkills from among a set of 8 potential predictor variables. Posted road speed limit was the dominant roadkill predictor (positive coefficient), followed by maximum daily temperature (positive), habitat diversity (positive), and distance from wetlands (negative). All else being equal, as road speed limits increase from 20 km/hr to 50 km/hr, the model predicted the season's mean road},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. },

The probability of elk occurring near the highway decreased with increasing traffic volume, indicating that elk used habitat near the highway primarily when traffic volumes were low (< 100 vehicles/hr). We used multiple logistic regression followed by model selection using Akaike's Information Criterion to identify factors influencing probability of elk crossings. We found that increasing traffic rates reduced the overall probability of highway crossing, but this effect depended on both season and the proximity of riparian meadow habitat. Elk crossed highways at higher traffic volumes when accessing high quality foraging areas. Our results indicate that 1) managers assessing habitat quality for elk in areas with high traffic-volume highways should consider that habitat near highways may be utilized at low traffic volumes, 2) in areas where highways potentially act as barriers to elk movement, increasing traffic volume decreases the probability of highway crossings, but the magnitude of this effect depends on both season and proximity of important resources, and 3) because some highway crossings still occurred at the high traffic volumes we recorded, increasing traffic alone will not prevent elk-vehicle collisions. Managers concerned with elk-vehicle collisions could increase the effectiveness of wildlife crossing structures by placing them near important resources, such as riparian meadow habitat.},

Although roadkill is associated mainly with traffic density, some life-history traits of species and the area surrounding roads are expected to modify number of roadkills both taxonomically and geographically. Here we studied the number of roadkills of vertebrates in an extensive region in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula. We surveyed 820 km of 41 roads in two different seasons (spring and autumn), that differ in traffic intensity. In addition, we covered zones with distinct climatic characteristics and levels of protection of the surrounding habitats. Amphibians showed the highest number of roadkills whereas reptiles, birds and mammals had similar rates. General Linear Model tests showed no differences in roadkills by climatic region; however, differences in number of roadkills were linked to protection status, with the highest number of casualties in highly protected areas. Redundancy Analysis demonstrated that the number of amphibians and reptiles killed was associated with roads in highly protected areas whereas that of mammals and birds was linked to unprotected areas. Protected areas often receive many visitors, which in turn may increase wildlife casualties as a result of greater traffic density. We recommend that correction measures be taken to reduce the high number of vertebrate fauna killed along roads that cross protected areas.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a considerable literature in spatiotemporal modelling. The approach adopted here applies to the setting where space is viewed as continuous but time is taken to be discrete. We view the data as a time series of spatial processes and work in the setting of dynamic models, achieving a class of dynamic models for such data. We seek rich, flexible, easy-to-specify, easy-to-interpret, computationally tractable specifications which allow very general mean structures and also non-stationary association structures.Our modelling contributions are as follows. In the case where univariate data are collected at the spatial locations, we propose the use of a spatiotemporally varying coefficient form. In the case where multivariate data are collected at the locations, we need to capture associations among measurements at a given location and time as well as dependence across space and time. We propose the use of suitable multivariate spatial process models developed through coregionalization.We adopt a Bayesian inference framework. The resulting posterior and predictive inference enables summaries in the form of tables and maps, which help to reveal the nature of the spatiotemporal behaviour as well as the associated uncertainty. We illuminate various computational issues and then apply our models to the analysis of climate data obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research to analyze precipitation and temperature measurements obtained in Colorado in 1997.

  Abstract                 = {In mammals, lactation is the most energetically demanding component of female reproduction. Theory predicts an increase in food intake by lactating females, but very few studies have used contraceptives to experimentally test the influence of reproduction on foraging behaviour of wild mammals. From 2009 to 2011, we observed 182 individually marked female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, in two populations, including 29 that received an experimental contraceptive treatment. We sought to determine whether lactating females increase their foraging rate compared to contracepted and naturally nonlactating females. The proportion of time spent foraging during 10&#xa0;min focal samples did not vary according to reproductive status in one population. In the other, lactating females spent 4\% less time feeding than nonlactating females. Day and midday activity and bite and chewing rates were higher in lactating than in nonlactating females. Bite rate increased with the size of the pouch young and was higher for mothers of sons than for mothers of daughters. Bite rate was also affected by reproductive effort in the previous year, being higher for females that had weaned a young. Foraging behaviour was independent of body mass and group size, but bite rate appeared to decrease with female age. In one population, we found strong effects of date and year on foraging behaviour. Our study is a rare experimental manipulation of reproduction in free-ranging large mammals. We found that foraging behaviours were affected by both previous and current reproductive effort and varied with individual characteristics and environmental conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Road fatalities are among the major causes of mortality for Strigiformes species and may affect the population’s survival. The use of mitigation strategies must be considered to overcome this problem. However, because mitigation along the total length of all roads is not financially feasible, the locations where Strigiformes roadkills are more frequent (i.e., road fatality hotspots) must be identified. In addition to hotspot identification, factors that influence the occurrence of such fatalities should be recognized to allow mitigation measures to be delineated. We used road fatality data collected from 311 km of southern Portugal roads over a 2-year period to compare the performance of five hotspot identifica- tion methods: binary logistic regression (BLR), ecolog- ical niche factor analysis (ENFA), Kernel density estimation, nearest neighbor hierarchical clustering (NNHC), and Malo’s method. BLR and ENFA mod- elling were also used for recognizing roadkill determin- istic factors. Our results suggest that Malo’s method should be preferred for hotspot identification. The main factors driving owl roadkillings are those associated with good habitat conditions for species occurrence and specific conditions that promote hunting behavior near roads. Based on these factors, several mitigation mea- sures are recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {Many carnivores have been seriously impacted by the expansion of transportation systems and networks; however we know little about carnivore response to the extent and magni- tude of road mortality, or which age classes may be disproportionately impacted. Recent research has demonstrated that wildlife–vehicle-collisions (WVC) involving carnivores are modulated by temporal and spatial factors. Thus, we investigated road mortality on a guild of small and medium-sized carnivores in southern Portugal using road-kill data obtained from a systematic 36 months monitoring period along highways (260 km) and national roads (314 km) by addressing the following questions: (a) which species and age class are most vulnerable to WVC? (b) are there temporal and/or spatial patterns in road- kill? and (c) which life-history and/or spatial factors influence the likelihood of collisions? We recorded a total of 806 carnivore casualties, which represented an average of 47 ind./ 100 km/year. Red fox and stone marten had the highest mortality rates. Our findings high- light three key messages: (1) the majority of road-killed individuals were adults of common species; (2) all carnivores, except genets, were more vulnerable during specific life-history phenological periods: higher casualties were observed when red fox and stone marten were provisioning young, Eurasian badger casualties occurred more frequently during dispersal, and higher Egyptian mongoose mortality occurred during the breeding period; and (3) mod- eling demonstrated that favorable habitat, curves in the road, and low human disturbance were major contributors to the deadliest road segments. Red fox carcasses were more likely to be found on road sections with passages distant from urban areas. Conversely, stone marten mortalities were found more often on national roads with high of cork oak wood- land cover; Egyptian mongoose and genet road-kills were found more often on road seg- ments close to curves. Based on our results, two key mitigation measures should help to reduce WVC in Portugal. The first involves the improvement of existing crossings with bur- ied and small mesh size fence to guide the individuals towards to the passages, in road seg- ments with high traffic volume (>1200 vehicles/night) and located in preferred carnivore habitats. The second mitigation involves cutting or removal of dense vegetation in verges of road segments with curves to aid motorists in seeing animals about to cross.},

  Abstract                 = {We used logistic models to estimate the risk of moose-train collisions for the Rorosbanen railway in Norway. During 1990-1997, a total of 13,506 train departures were registered along Rorosbanen during the months when the risk of collision was highest (December to March). The statistical model selected to predict the risk of moose-train collisions included train route, time of day, lunar phase and average train speed, as well as two climatic covariables, i.e. snow depth and temperature. Trains running at night, in the morning or in the evening experienced a higher risk of collision with moose Alces alces than day trains. The probability of collision was also higher during nights of full moons than during nights of half or no moons. As observed previously with trains in Norway moose-kills increased with increasing snow depth and decreasing temperatures. To test the predictability of the model, we used a logistic model based on train departures during 1990-1996 to predict the number of moose-train accidents during winter 1996/97. Although the model had a satisfactorily high predictability, the best models would probably be those based on a combination of both temporal and spatial aspects. We discuss how logistic models may be applied to introduce remedial actions on high-risk routes or during high-risk periods.},

  abstract  = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) pose a sig- nificant safety and conservation concern in areas where high-traffic roads are situated adjacent to wildlife habitat. Improving transportation safety, accurately planning high- way mitigation, and identifying key habitat linkage areas may all depend on the quality of WVC data collection. Two common approaches to describe the location of WVCs are spatially accurate data derived from global positioning systems (GPS) or vehicle odometer measurements and less accurate road-marker data derived from reference points (e.g., mile-markers or landmarks) along the roadside. In addition, there are two common variable types used to pre- dict WVC locations: (1) field-derived, site-specific mea- surements and (2) geographic information system (GIS)- derived information. It is unclear whether these different approaches produce similar results when attempting to identify and explain the location of WVCs. Our first objec- tive was to determine and compare the spatial error found in road-marker data (in our case the closest mile-marker) and landmark-referenced data. Our second objective was to evaluate the performance of models explaining high- and low-probability WVC locations, using congruent, spatially accurate (\3-m) and road-marker (\800-m) response vari- ables in combination with field- and GIS-derived explana- tory variables. Our WVC data sets were comprised of ungulate collisions and were located along five major roads in the central Canadian Rocky Mountains. We found that spatial error (mean ± SD) was higher for WVC data refer- enced to nearby landmarks (516 ± 808 m) than for data referenced to the closest mile-marker data (401 ± 219 m). The top-performing model using the spatially accurate WVC locations contained all explanatory variable types, whereas GIS-derived variables were only influential in the best road-marker model and the spatially accurate reduced model. Our study showed that spatial error and sample size, using road-marker data for ungulate species, are important to consider for model output interpretation, which will impact the appropriate scale on which to apply modeling results. Using road-marker references\1.6 km or GPS-derived data locations may represent an optimal compromise between data acquisition costs and analytical performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Roads are more frequently fragmenting natural habitats increasing the likelihood of collisions between wildlife and vehicles. The Canada Species at Risk Act (2002) lists species that are threatened with regional extinction, and roads have been identified as a significant threat for many of these wildlife species in Ontario, e.g. turtles. In response to negative road impacts on wildlife, we developed a GIS modeling tool that predicts high-risk road mortality locations for selected wetland-forest herpetofaunal species that are representative of the landscape. We obtained a habitat suitability index (sum of weighted habitat scores) within a 12.6 hectare buffer surrounding each 15 x 15 m pixel of road in the landscape. Validation of the final model with dead and alive on-road herpetofaunal data showed animals were more at risk of road mortality when roads bisected large areas of wetland-forest habitat. The tool has been effective to promote proactive mitigation planning within government transportation agencies at the municipal and provincial level. Future work will develop species-specific models that identify road mortality locations along roads that re-connect habitat from a local and metapopulation perspective. In addition, the models will be used to prioritize locations along roads for effective mitigation solutions, e.g. turtle crossing signs and wildlife crossing structures.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to posing a serious risk to motorist safety, vehicle collisions with wildlife are a significant threat for many species. Previous spatial modeling has concluded that wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) exhibit clustering on roads, which is attributed to specific landscape and road-related factors. We reviewed twenty-four published manuscripts that used generalized linear models to statistically determine the influence that numerous explanatory predictors have on the location of WVCs. Our motivation was to summarize empirical \{WVC\} findings to facilitate application of this knowledge to planning, and design of mitigation strategies on roads. In addition, commonalities between studies were discussed and recommendations for future model design were made. We summarized the type and measurement of each significant predictor and whether they potentially increased or decreased the occurrence of collisions with ungulates, carnivores, small-medium vertebrates, birds, and amphibians and reptiles. \{WVCs\} commonly occurred when roads bisect favorable cover, foraging, or breeding habitat for specific species or groups of species. \{WVCs\} were generally highest on road sections with high traffic volumes, or low motorist visibility, and when roads cut through drainage movement corridors, or level terrain. Ungulates, birds, small-medium vertebrates, and carnivore collision locations were associated with road-side vegetation and other features such as salt pools. In several cases, results were spurious due to confounding and interacting predictors within the same model. For example, \{WVCs\} were less likely to occur when a road bisected steep slopes; however, steep slopes may be located along specific road-types and habitat that also influence the occurrence of WVCs. In conclusion, this review showed that much of the current literature has gleaned the obvious, broad-scale relationships between \{WVCs\} and predictors from available data sets, and localized studies can provide unique and novel results. Future research requires specific modeling for each target species on a road-by-road basis, and measuring the predictive power of model results within similar landscapes. In addition, research that builds on the current literature by investigating rare anomalies and interacting variables will assist in providing sound comprehensive guidelines for wildlife mitigation planning on roads.},

  Abstract                 = {The majority of the world’s road network is made up of low-class/low-volume roads. Most of these roads are omitted from asset management and preventative maintenance programs. In order to benefit from these programs, traffic statistics such as traffic volume are needed but are often not available for large portions of the low-class/low- volume road network. This thesis describes a study using a travel demand model (TDM) to estimate traffic volumes on low-class roads in New Brunswick, Canada. The model was implemented in York County and the Census Consolidated Subdivision of Beresford. The results from the county case showed that estimates for arterial roads had the lowest average error (9\%), followed by collectors (45\%), and local roads (160\%). Reducing the study area size resulted in increased estimation accuracy. The overall average error in the census consolidated subdivision estimates was 17\%. In particular, estimation errors for local roads were limited to less than 40\%. While the estimation errors for the local roads are still relatively high, the forecasted traffic volumes provide a solid foundation for identifying high-volume road segments and prioritizing funding. In both cases, the TDM produced a large amount of data for roads that previously had none. Available data were increased by 45\% in York County and 144\% in the Beresford area. Study results clearly show TDM is a practical, useful, cost-effective way for estimating traffic parameters on low-class roads and its implementation would lead to an extended asset management program and improved level of service on these roads.},

  Abstract                 = {Species distribution models have come under criticism for being too simplistic for making robust future forecasts, partly because they assume that climate is the main determinant of geographical range at large spatial extents and coarse resolutions, with non-climate predictors being important only at finer scales. We suggest that this paradigm might be obscured by species movement patterns. To explore this we used contrasting kangaroo (family Macropodidae) case studies: two species with relatively small, stable home ranges (Macropus giganteus and M. robustus) and three species with more extensive, adaptive ranging behaviour (M. antilopinus, M. fuliginosus and M. rufus). We predicted that non-climate predictors will be most influential to model fit and predictive performance at local spatial resolution for the former species and at landscape resolution for the latter species. We compared residuals autocovariate – boosted regression tree (RAC-BRT) model statistics with and without species-specific non-climate predictors (habitat, soil, fire, water and topography), at local- and landscape-level spatial resolutions (5 and 50 km). As predicted, the influence of non-climate predictors on model fit and predictive performance (compared with climate-only models) was greater at 50 compared with 5 km resolution for M. rufus and M. fuliginosus and the opposite trend was observed for M. giganteus. The results for M. robustus and M. antilopinus were inconclusive. Also notable was the difference in inter-scale importance of climate predictors in the presence of non-climate predictors. In conclusion, differences in autecology, particularly relating to space use, may contribute to the importance of non-climate predictors at a given scale, not model scale per se. Further exploration of this concept across a range of species is encouraged and findings may contribute to more effective conservation and management of species at ecologically meaningful scales.},

The rate of movement of 203 adult amphibians was recorded. Information on traffic loads was provided, and mortality risk was calculated depending on traffic loads and movement rate. The probability of getting killed ranged from 0.34 to 0.61 when crossing a road with a traffic load of 3,207 vehicles/ day, and from 0.89 to 0.98 when crossing a motorway. The number of amphibians killed on the road was estimated by systematic counts. Population sizes were estimated for all ponds within 250m of the relevant highway stretch. Results indicate that about 10% of the adult population of P. fuscus and brown frogs (R. temporaria and R. arvalis) were killed annually by traffic at this site.},

As quality and quantity of forage reserves declined, animals made progressively greater use of cleared areas. This resulted in marked seasonal changes in distribution patterns. Of the variables quantified (rainfall, soil moisture storage and pasture growth), rainfall provided the best correlations with kangaroo usage of cleared country, explaining 55\% (P= 0,002) of the variation in distribution at Warwick and 91\% (P= 0,001) of that at Bollon.},

  Abstract                 = {Ungulates, in particular the Central European roe deer Capreolus capreolus and the North American white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, are economically and ecologically important. The two species are risk factors for deer–vehicle collisions and as browsers of palatable trees have implications for forest regeneration. However, no large-scale management systems for ungulates have been implemented, mainly because of the high efforts and costs associated with attempts to estimate population sizes of free-living ungulates living in a complex landscape. Attempts to directly estimate population sizes of deer are problematic owing to poor data quality and lack of spatial representation on larger scales. We used data on w74,000 deer–vehicle collisions observed in 2006 and 2009 in Bavaria, Germany, to model the local risk of deer–vehicle collisions and to investigate the relationship between deer–vehicle collisions and both environmental conditions and browsing intensities. An innovative modelling approach for the number of deer–vehicle collisions, which allows nonlinear environment–deer relationships and assessment of spatial heterogeneity, was the basis for estimating the local risk of collisions for specific road types on the scale of Bavarian municipalities. Based on this risk model, we propose a new ‘‘deer– vehicle collision index’’ for deer management. We show that the risk of deer–vehicle collisions is positively correlated to browsing intensity and to harvest numbers. Overall, our results demonstrate that the number of deer–vehicle collisions can be predicted with high precision on the scale of municipalities. In the densely populated and intensively used landscapes of Central Europe and North America, a model-based risk assessment for deer–vehicle collisions provides a cost-efficient instrument for deer management on the landscape scale. The measures derived from our model provide valuable information for planning road protection and defining hunting quota. Open-source software implementing the model can be used to transfer our modelling approach to wildlife–vehicle collisions elsewhere.},

  Abstract                 = {America’s highways allow people and products to travel to every corner of our nation. Along the way, these roads cross through the habitat of many native wildlife species. When these paths intersect, collisions can occur, and in greater numbers than most people realize. Based on the results of this study, there are an estimated one to two million collisions between cars and large animals every year in the U.S. This presents a real danger to human safety as well as wildlife survival. State and local transportation agencies are looking for ways to meet the needs of the traveling public, maintain human safety and conserve wildlife. Under Section 1119 (n) of the Safe Accountable Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), the US Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a national Wildlife Vehicle Collision (WVC) study. This study details the causes and impacts of wildlife vehicle collisions and identifies potential solutions to this growing safety problem. The report focuses on mitigation methods that reduce the number of collisions between vehicles and large wildlife, such as deer, because these accidents present the greatest safety danger to travelers, and cause the most damage. This summary of the full report highlights the major findings and serves as an introduction to the issue of WVCs.},

  Abstract                 = {Animal-vehicle collisions affect human safety, property and wildlife, and the number of animal- vehicle collisions has substantially increased across much of North America over the last decades. Systematically collected animal-vehicle collision data help estimate the magnitude of the problem and help record potential changes in animal-vehicle collisions over time. Such data also allow for the identification and prioritization of locations that may require mitigation. Furthermore, systematically collected animal-vehicle collision data allow for the evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation measures in reducing the number of animal-vehicle collisions. In the United States and Canada, animal-vehicle collision data are typically collected and managed by transportation agencies, law enforcement agencies and/or natural resource management agencies. These activities result in two types of data: data from accident reports (AR data) and data based on animal carcass counts (AC data). Here we report on a survey that examined the extent to which AR and AC data are collected across the United States and Canada. While a substantial percentage of the DOTs and DNRs collect and manage AR and/or AC data, many of them do not. Furthermore, DOTs and DNRs that do collect or manage AR or AC data typically do this for different or only partly overlapping reasons. In addition, DOTs and DNRs use different reporting thresholds, have varying search and reporting effort, and only have partial overlap in the parameters recorded. These differences also occur between DOTs and between DNRs, and oftentimes one and the same organization collects inconsistent data as certain parameters may only be recorded ‘sometimes’. These differences and inconsistencies affect the comparability and ultimately the usefulness of the data. Before an AR or AC program is initiated or improved, it is important to illustrate the needs and benefits of such data collection. We list the most important needs and benefits and provide considerations for the initiation or improvement of AR and AC data collection programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Wildlife–vehicle collisions have important ecological, economic, and social effects. In North America and across northern Europe, moose (Alces alces) are one of the largest ungulates hit by motor vehicles. The force and increasing frequency of these collisions has resulted in a commitment by wildlife and transportation agencies to limit or reduce causal factors. In an effort to improve these mitigation strategies, we used the most readily available source of knowledge of collision factors, expert opinion, to develop a series of models that explained and predicted location of moose–vehicle collisions (MVC). We developed expert-based models using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and we used a structured survey approach where experts could assess criteria relevancy, weight criteria, and review weights for consistency. We hypothesized that collisions were the product of habitat- or driver-related factors and we formulated the survey accordingly. We used the receiver operating characteristic to validate the resulting models and the Kappa index of agreement to quantify differences among spatial predictions originating from the experts. Local and nonlocal experts weighted the moose habitat classification as the most important criterion for identifying MVC. Among driver-related criteria, speed limit was weighted as the most important factor. Overall, habitat-based models were more proficient than driver-based models in predicting MVC within Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks, Canada. Both local and nonlocal expert models were excellent predictors of MVC, with local experts slightly outperforming nonlocal experts. Considering that habitat-related criteria were more powerful for predicting MVC, and that habitat can vary considerably across study areas, we suggest that local experts be used when possible. The AHP is a valuable tool for wildlife, highway, and park managers to better understand why and where wildlife–vehicle collisions occur. Adopting this process, our data suggested that MVC were most strongly correlated with highway attractants associated with habitat. Vegetation management or alternative routing could minimize spatial juxtaposition of moose and motor vehicles.},

  Abstract                 = {Armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) are one of the mammals most commonly found dead along Florida highways. Thus, they may serve as a model to study which factors are affecting wildlife road-kills. Armadillo diurnal activity and road-kills were examined along a 168.9-km stretch of the Ronald Reagan Turnpike in Florida. We conducted 49 surveys during a 13-month period (3-5 surveys/month), with 143 road-kill incidents and 173 observations of active armadillos. Activity and road-kills were spatially and temporally correlated with several factors. Rate of armadillo road-kill was from interactions among temperature, vegetation coverage, and traffic volume. During winter (November-March), armadillos are more diurnal and generally less active, thus they are less likely to be killed by vehicles. Armadillo activity in these months was concentrated near habitat with dense woodlands. In summer, armadillos are predominantly nocturnal and apparently more active. Consequently, their road-kill rates nearly doubled and were highly correlated with traffic volume, but not with vegetation. Of all the traffic-volume data sets, mean nighttime traffic generated the only significant correlation with road-kills. Traffic did not affect armadillo diurnal activity. Our study demonstrated how the relative importance of the factors affecting road-ki II changed temporally. Spatial analyses suggested that armadillos are more dispersed during summer.},

The second tool is GIS-based and not only models the movement patterns of animals but also estimates an animal's daily number of road crossings. With data on population size as well as on road and traffic characteristics, a combination of both tools provides a measure of the mortality risk roads pose to wildlife in an area. Such estimations proved to be invaluable in a planning process with local inhabitants in the municipality of Brummen (the Netherlands), where ecological as well as safety problems appear. Our study demonstrates the applicability of GIS tools in balancing ecological consequences of road network options with a different distribution of traffic flows over the area in spatial planning and ecology.},

  Abstract                 = {A model is developed to look at the probability of successful road traversing by mammals, based on Poisson-distributed arrivals of cars. It is a double ‘blind’ model presuming that a collision occurs when the animal and the car are on the same part of the road at the same time. When a car and an animal impact, two types of collisions can occur: ‘car hits animal’ and ‘animal hits car’. The probability of these events, and thus the probability of successful road traversing by animals, is determined by road, traffic, vehicle, and species characteristics. Use of the model shows that, for the parameter ranges, traffic volume and the animals’ traversing speed have the largest effects on whether a collision occurs. This model is applied to compare alternative network solutions and to evaluate traffic calming measures on a former arterial highway. It is shown that these measures are effective in mitigating traffic mortality among mammals.},

Locations of kangaroos were determined by sighting number- collared or radio-collared individuals. The ellipse model was used to determine diurnal home range area, orientation, and geographical mean center. Those females and males occupying the primary study area had similar home range areas (x = 23.2 and 20.5 ha for M and F, respectively). Orientation and geographical center of the range varied with both time of day and season due to movements related to sheltering behavior. In winter, diurnal shelter was not sought and forage was poor; activity centers shifted further into the open pasture than in spring. Home range area of females was significantly reduced when accompanied by young. A modified harmonic mean model was used to determine home range areas and to assess longer-term shifts in activity centers for widely ranging males. The ability of this method to discriminate multiple activity centers resolved long-term movement patterns of radio-tracked males, which were related to transient associations with female groups during the spring-summer mating period. The fourier transform model was used to determine home range areas and boundaries. These areas were much smaller than those determined by the other 2 methods, and the boundaries were often discontinuous.},

  Abstract                 = {Animalevehicle collisions (AVCs) are a serious problem that can result in property damage and human and animal injury and death. This study investigated the role that elevation, slope, and vegetation may have in AVC locations (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus and elk Cervus canadensis) in several canyon corridors in north central Utah. This was done by comparing these characteristics around known AVCs with those around control points where AVCs did not occur. The study found that elevation was significantly lower around AVC points, slope was significantly greater, and there was no difference in overall vegetation when measured with NDVI, but there was a difference in percentage of Sage brush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt) steppe around the points. AVCs may occur in these areas because mule deer tend to be more active in the lower elevations and use steeper slope for cover. Also, in areas with greater slope, the road will probably be curvier and provide less driver visibility than in areas with less steep slope. These results may help guide where to place deer warning signs and other AVC mitigation strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In recent years, Bayesian random effect models that account for the temporal and spatial correlations of crash data became popular in traffic safety research. This study employs random effect Poisson Log-Normal models for crash risk hotspot identification. Both the temporal and spatial correlations of crash data were considered. Potential for Safety Improvement (PSI) were adopted as a measure of the crash risk. Using the fatal and injury crashes that occurred on urban 4-lane divided arterials from 2006 to 2009 in the Central Florida area, the random effect approaches were compared to the traditional Empirical Bayesian (EB) method and the conventional Bayesian Poisson Log-Normal model. A series of method examination tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of different approaches. These tests include the previously developed site consistence test, method consistence test, total rank difference test, and the modified total score test, as well as the newly proposed total safety performance measure difference test. Results show that the Bayesian Poisson model accounting for both temporal and spatial random effects (PTSRE) outperforms the model that with only temporal random effect, and both are superior to the conventional Poisson Log-Normal model (PLN) and the \{EB\} model in the fitting of crash data. Additionally, the method evaluation tests indicate that the \{PTSRE\} model is significantly superior to the \{PLN\} model and the \{EB\} model in consistently identifying hotspots during successive time periods. The results suggest that the \{PTSRE\} model is a superior alternative for road site crash risk hotspot identification. },

  Abstract                 = {In Newfoundland, 5,422 moose-vehicle collisions (MVCs) occurred between 1988 and 1994, resulting in 14 human and approximately 4,800 moose (Alces alces) fatalities. We examined daily, seasonal, and spatial distribution patterns of MVCs and used log-linear modeling to assess effects of darkness, posted speed limits, road condition, vehicle occu- pants, and road alignment on severity of human injury resulting from such collisions. Seventy-five percent of all MVCs occurred between dusk and dawn. We found no dif- ferences among diurnal patterns of MVCs involving moose of different sex and age groups. Seasonally, 70°/O of MVCs occurred between June and October and peak acci- dent periods differed somewhat among moose age classes (calf, yearling, adult). How- ever, we found no seasonal differences between males and females. Spatially, MVCs were dependenton moose densities and traffic volume, with greater probability of MVCs in areas of high or low (but not moderate) moose densities and high traffic flow. Risk of severe human injury was 2.0 times greater at highway speeds ranging from 80 to 100 km/hour and 2.1 times greater at night. Human injuries were more severe for MVCs occurring when road conditions were dry and when passengers were present. We found no relationship between road alignment and injury severity, although 79% of MVCs occurred on straight sections of highway. The predominant influence of darkness on MVCs may result from low light conditions and increased movement of moose at night. The high occurrence of MVCs under dry road conditions and on straight sections of road was surprising and may indicate inadequate driver attention to potential road hazards. We suggest that a long-term driver education program may be the only viable mitigation effort available to reduce number of MVCs},

We used a GIS to characterize both the locations of roadkills and random points according to elevation, land use, distance to open water, traffic speed and number of observers on the road and then used logistic regression to determine the association of roadkill sites with these variables. Dead opossums were found most often at low-elevation sites with less forest cover and more human development.

  abstract  = {Kangaroo–vehicle collisions are frequent on Australian highways. Despite high economic costs, detrimental effects on animal welfare, and potential impacts on population viability, little research has been done to investigate the impact of road mortality on kangaroo populations, where and why accidents occur, and how the collisions can be mitigated. We therefore collected data on species (Macropus rufus, M. giganteus, M. fuliginosus, M. robustus), sex and age of kangaroos killed on a 21.2-km bitumenised section of outback highway over 6 months in far western New South Wales, Australia. The spatial and temporal distribution of road-killed kangaroos was investigated in relation to the cover and quality of road-side vegetation, road characteristics, the density of kangaroos along the road, climatic variables and traffic volume. A total of 125 kangaroos were found killed on the road at a rate of 0.03 deaths km–1 day–1. Grey kangaroos of two species (M. giganteus, M. fuliginosus) were under- represented in the road-kill sample in comparison with their proportion in the source population estimated during the day. No bias towards either sex was found. The age structure of road-killed kangaroos was similar to age structures typical of source kangaroo populations. Road-kills mainly occurred in open plains country. In road sections with curves or stock races, road-kill frequencies were higher than expected. Greater cover and greenness of roadside vegetation at the verge probably attracted kangaroos to the road and variation in this vegetation affected the spatial distribution of road-kills. The temporal distribution of road-kills was positively correlated with the volume of night-time traffic. The probability of a kangaroo–vehicle collision increased exponentially with traffic volume. Results are discussed in relation to the potential for mitigation of kangaroo–vehicle collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of the relationship between wildlife and roads is important for management of wildlife–vehicle collisions, which represent a serious threat to many wildlife populations and to human life and property. Effective reduction of these threats requires identification of variables influencing collision locations, and the use of these variables in spatially-explicit predictive models. We used Penrose distance modeling and 61 confirmed bobcat (Lynx rufus) road mortality locations in southern Illinois, USA, to demonstrate a rapid and accurate technique for the spatial mapping of wildlife–vehicle collision risk. We used the Penrose distance statistic to quantify the similarity between the mean multivariate habitat signature at bobcat-collision areas and road sections throughout the study area. Habitat variables assessed included road-related variables (e.g., traffic volume) and land cover characteristics (e.g., mean patch area of the landscape). Bobcat-collision areas were characterized by smaller, less-clustered habitat patches and more, large independent patches of grass cover than were study area roadway sections in general. As expected for a generalist carnivore in highly-suitable habitat, risk mapping indicated that large sections of the roaded landscape had high similarity to bobcat-collision areas. Unlike other modeling techniques used to identify risk of road mortality, our method requires little field data collection and relies on readily available digital spatial data. This technique can be used by wildlife managers and road planners, and may be particularly important in reduction of road mortality for species such as the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), and Texas ocelot (Leopardis pardalus), which exist in small populations fragmented by development, and are limited by road mortalities. },

This phenomenon has been attributed to exceptional elastic energy storage and recovery via long compliant tendons in the legs. Alternatively, red kangaroos may have exceptionally efficient muscles. To estimate efficiency, we measured the metabolic cost of uphill hopping, where muscle fibers must perform mechanical work against gravity. We found that uphill hopping was much more expensive than level hopping. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption measured (3 ml O2 kg − 1 s − 1) exceeds all but a few vertebrate species. However, efficiency values were normal, 30%. At faster level hopping speeds the effective mechanical advantage of the extensor muscles of the ankle joint remained the same. Thus, kangaroos generate the same muscular force at all speeds but do so more rapidly at faster hopping speeds. This contradicts a recent hypothesis for what sets the cost of locomotion. The cost of transport (J kg−1 m − 1) decreases at faster hopping speeds, yet red kangaroos prefer to use relatively slow speeds that avoid high levels of tendon stress.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecologists that study the population dynamics of large and small herbivorous mammals operate in two worlds that overlap only partly, and in this paper I address whether the conjecture that these worlds represent two distinct and valid paradigms is currently justified. I argue that large mammals fall into three groups depending on whether they have effective predators or not, and whether they are harvested by humans. Because of human persecution of large predators, more and more large herbivorous mammals are effectively predator-free and are controlled bottom-up by food. But in less disturbed systems, large herbivorous mammals should be controlled top-down by effective predators, and this can lead to a trophic cascade. Small herbivorous mammals have been suggested to be controlled top-down by predators but some experimental evidence has challenged this idea and replaced it with the notion that predation is one of several factors that may affect rates of population increase. Intrinsic control (territoriality, infanticide, social inhibition of breeding) appears to be common in small herbivorous mammals with altricial young but is absent in species with precocial young, in ecosystems with strong stochastic weather variation (deserts) and in areas of human-induced habitat fragmentation in agricultural monocultures. The extrinsic control of large herbivores with precocial young validates part of Graeme Caughley's Grand Vision, but the relative role of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for small herbivores with altricial young is still controversial. An improved knowledge of population control mechanisms for large and small herbivores is essential for natural resource management.},

  Abstract                 = {Road mortality is often spatially aggregated, and there is a need for models that accurately and efficiently predict hot spots within a road network for mitigation. We surveyed 145 points throughout a 353-km highway network in New York State, USA, for roadkill of reptiles and amphibians. We used land cover, wetland configuration, and traffic volume data to identify features that best predicted hot spots of herpetofauna road mortality. We resampled 40 points an additional 4 times over 4 years to evaluate temporal repeatability. Both amphibian and reptile road mortality were spatially clustered, and road-kill hot spots of the 2 taxa overlapped. One survey provided a valid snapshot of spatial patterns of road mortality, and spatial patterns remained stable across time. Road-kill hot spots were located where wetlands approached within 100 m of the road, and the best predictor was a causeway configuration of wetlands (wetlands on both sides of the road). We validated causeways as predictors of road mortality by surveying 180 causeways and 180 random points across 5 regions (17,823 km 2 ) of northeastern New York. Causeways were 3 times more likely than random locations to have amphibian and 12 times more likely to have reptile mortality present, and causeways had a 4 times higher total number of amphibian roadkill and 9 times higher reptile roadkill than did random points. We conclude it is possible to identify valid predictors of hot spots of amphibian and reptile road mortality for use when planning roads or when conducting surveys on existing roads to locate priority areas for mitigation.},

These impacts are mainly studied and mitigated on major roads. It is, however, a widespread misconception that most animals are killed on major roads. In this paper, we argue that minor roads have a larger impact on wildlife with respect to habitat destruction, noise load and traffic mortality. We use data on traffic related deaths in badgers (Meles meles) in The Netherlands to illustrate that traffic mortality is higher on minor roads. We ask for a more extensive investigation of the environmental impacts of minor roads. Moreover, we argue that the success of mitigation on roads drastically increases when both major and minor roads are integrated in the planning of traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a strategy based on the concept of a ‘‘traffic-calmed area’’. Traffic-calmed areas create opportunities for wildlife by decreasing limitations for animal movement. We ask for further studies to estimate what size traffic-calmed areas should be to maintain minimum viable animal populations.},

This study evaluates risk factors associated with fatal animal-vehicle collisions. Methods.—This study evaluates characteristics of fatal animal-vehicle collisions in the United States from 1995–2004 by using the Fatality Accident Reporting System database of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Results.—An average of 165 deaths occurred each year during this 10-year time period. Most deaths occurred in rural areas, during the fall months, on straight roads, and in clear weather, and an increasing trend for deaths was noted over this time period. Conclusion.—The number of fatal animal-vehicle collisions is increasing. Various methods to re- duce such collisions are described, with fencing appearing to be the most effective. The use of personal restraints such as seat belts in passenger vehicles and helmets for motorcycle and all-terrain-vehicle riders may decrease fatalities during a collision.},

  Abstract                 = {Two types of animal-vehicle collision (AVC) data are commonly adopted for AVC-related risk analysis research: reported \{AVC\} data and carcass removal data. One issue with these two data sets is that they were found to have significant discrepancies by previous studies. In order to model these two types of data together and provide a better understanding of highway AVCs, this study adopts a diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson regression method, an inflated version of bivariate Poisson regression model, to fit the reported \{AVC\} and carcass removal data sets collected in Washington State during 2002–2006. The diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson model not only can model paired data with correlation, but also handle under- or over-dispersed data sets as well. Compared with three other types of models, double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, and zero-inflated double Poisson, the diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson model demonstrates its capability of fitting two data sets with remarkable overlapping portions resulting from the same stochastic process. Therefore, the diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson model provides researchers a new approach to investigating \{AVCs\} from a different perspective involving the three distribution parameters (λ1, λ2 and λ3). The modeling results show the impacts of traffic elements, geometric design and geographic characteristics on the occurrences of both reported \{AVC\} and carcass removal data. It is found that the increase of some associated factors, such as speed limit, annual average daily traffic, and shoulder width, will increase the numbers of reported \{AVCs\} and carcass removals. Conversely, the presence of some geometric factors, such as rolling and mountainous terrain, will decrease the number of reported AVCs. },

Counter measures against AVCs are urgently needed for traffic safety and wildlife conser- vation.

However, these existing models seldom take human factors and animal attributes into account. This paper presents a new probability model which explicitly formulates the interactions between animals and drivers to better capture the relationship among drivers’ and animals’ attributes, roadway and environmental factors, and AVCs. Findings of this study show that speed limit, rural versus urban, and presence of white-tailed deer habitat have an increasing effect on AVC risk, whereas male animals, high truck percentage, and large number of lanes put a decreasing effect on AVC probability.},

  Abstract                 = {The reactions of large animals to vehicles approaching along roads and the role these reactions play in the likelihood of collisions with vehicles are not well understood. This study examined the flight responses of kangaroos (Macropus spp.) to an approaching vehicle to determine what factors influence flight responses, and whether flight responses influence collision likelihood. We recorded the behaviour of four kangaroo species (M. rufus, M. giganteus, M. fuliginosus and M. robustus erubescens) towards an approaching four-wheel-drive single-cab utility vehicle across a range of vehicle speeds, and compared kangaroo responses to the incidence of kangaroo-vehicle collisions on the same road over a two-year period. The study was conducted on the Fowlers Gap Research Station in north-west New South Wales. We found that the tendency to take flight was higher at night than during the day, and higher for M. rufus than for M. robustus erubescens during the night. Flight tendency was also higher in the absence of cover and in small groups for grey kangaroos. We found positive relationships between kangaroo flightiness and the likelihood of collisions and between species flightiness and collision frequency, suggesting that the behaviour of kangaroos in response to approaching vehicles has a direct bearing on their susceptibility to collisions with those vehicles. M. rufus were more susceptible to being hit than were M. robustus erubescens, while M. giganteus and M. fuliginosus had intermediate fatality rates. Kangaroos have evolved flight in an unpredictable direction along an erratic path to deal with high-level threats, as opposed to stationary vigilance behaviour for lower threat levels. We suggest that the degree to which oncoming vehicles invoke flight behaviour is a causative factor in collisions between kangaroos and vehicles.},

  abstract  = {The effects of roads on wildlife behaviour and ecological function are poorly known in arid Australia. The most obvious impact is roadkill from wildlife-vehicle collisions. Therefore we collected statistics on kangaroo-vehicle collisions, investigated the causal factors of these collisions, and related roadkill mortality to the population structure, size and distribution of four kangaroo species in two intensive six month studies during and following drought. The research was conducted along a 21.2 km sealed section of the Silver City Highway between Broken Hill and Tibooburra that passes through the University of New South Wales (NSW) Arid Zone Research Station at ‘Fowlers Gap’ in north-western NSW. The rate of roadkill was higher during drought (20.8 roadkills month-1) than non-drought (2.6 roadkills month-1). Affected species were red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), euros (Macropus robustus erubescens), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus). During drought, M. fuliginosus and M. giganteus were killed in lower proportions than their proportion in the source population, otherwise species were killed in proportion to their density along the road. There were no sex biases but male M. r. erubescens were much more likely to be beside the road than females and thus were killed more often during drought. The majority of roadkills were young individuals around 2 years old. Curves and stockraces along the road significantly increased the likelihood of roadkills. Likewise the frequency of roadkills was a function of the kangaroo population density along the road, night time traffic volume, low rainfall and higher vegetation cover and greenness along the road relative to surrounding areas. We evaluate the relationships between these causal factors and kangaroo- vehicle collisions, and discuss the possible effects of these collisions on kangaroo population structure under drought and post-drought conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The exploitation ecosystems hypothesis (EEH) makes predictions about trophic interactions along gradients of primary productivity. The EEH has been shown to apply to a wide range of terrestrial environments but its applicability to arid environments has received little attention. One reason for this is that arid environments may not satisfy the assumptions of the EEH because dearth of water may limit biological activity in both temporal and spatial contexts. The EEH predicts that herbivore biomass should increase linearly with primary productivity in the absence of predators; but when predators are present herbivore biomass will remain relatively constant due to top down regulation. We tested this prediction in an arid environment using rainfall as a proxy of primary productivity and an index of the abundance of the dominant herbivores (kangaroos Macropus spp.). We compared an index of kangaroo abundance at 18 areas situated along a gradient of mean annual rainfall in areas where a top predator (the dingo Canis lupus dingo) was rare and common. We also explored the relationship between the density of artificial water points (AWPs) and kangaroo abundance to investigate if the resource subsidy provided by AWPs allows kangaroos to persist in high numbers. Consistent with the EEH, kangaroo abundance showed a weak relationship with mean annual rainfall in the presence of dingoes but increased with increasing annual rainfall in the absence of dingoes. The density of AWPs was a poor predictor of kangaroo abundance. Our analysis of macro-ecological patterns suggests that kangaroo populations are primarily top down regulated in the presence of dingoes, but are bottom up regulated in the absence of dingoes. Our findings provide evidence that top down regulation can prevail over bottom up regulation of herbivore populations in arid ecosystems and highlights the usefulness of the EEH as a predictor of macro-ecological patterns of species abundance.},

Five-year crash data for Harris County (primarily the City of Houston), Texas are analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS), and spatial–temporal patterns of relative crash risks are identified based on a Bayesian approach. This approach is used to identify and rank roadway segments with potentially high risks for crashes so that preventive actions can be taken to reduce the risks in these segments. Results demonstrate the approach is useful in estimating the relative crash risks, eliminating the instability of estimates while maintaining overall safety trends. The 3-D posterior risk maps show risky roadway segments where safety improvements need to be implemented. Results of GIS-based Bayesian mapping are also useful for travelers to choose relatively safer routes. },

  abstract  = {Among the most conspicuous environmental effects of roads are vehicle-related mortalities of wildlife. Research to understand the factors that contribute to wildlife-vehicle collisions can be partitioned into several major themes, including (i) characteristics associated with roadkill hot spots, (ii) identification of road-density thresholds that limit wildlife populations, and (iii) species- specific models of vehicle collision rates that incorporate information on roads (e.g., proximity, width, and traffic volume) and animal movements. We suggest that collision models offer substantial opportunities to understand the effects of roads on a diverse suite of species. We conducted simulations using collision models and information on Blanding’s turtles (Emydoidea blandingii), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and moose (Alces alces), species endemic to the northeastern United States that are of particular concern relative to collisions with vehicles. Results revealed important species-specific differences, with traffic volume and rate of movement by candidate species having the greatest influence on collision rates. We recommend that future efforts to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions be more proactive and suggest the following protocol. For species that pose hazards to drivers (e.g., ungulates), identify col- lision hot spots and implement suitable mitigation to redirect animal movements (e.g., underpasses, fencing, and habitat modification), reduce populations of problematic game species via hunting, or modify driver behavior (e.g., dynamic signage that warns drivers when animals are near roads). Next, identify those species that are likely to experience additive (as opposed to compensatory) mortality from vehicle collisions and rank them according to vulnerability to extirpation. Then combine information on the distribution of at-risk species with information on existing road networks to identify areas where immediate actions are warranted.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable research conducted over the last 20 years focused on predicting motor vehicle crashes on transportation facilities. The range of statistical models commonly applied includes binomial, Poisson, Poisson-gamma (or negative binomial), zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial models (ZIP and ZINB), and multinomial probability models. Given the range of possible modeling approaches and the host of assumptions with each modeling approach, making an intelligent choice for modeling motor vehicle crash data is difficult. There is little discussion in the literature comparing different statistical modeling approaches, identifying which statistical models are most appropriate for modeling crash data, and providing a strong justification from basic crash principles. In the recent literature, it has been suggested that the motor vehicle crash process can successfully be modeled by assuming a dual-state data-generating process, which implies that entities (e.g., intersections, road segments, pedestrian crossings, etc.) exist in one of two states—perfectly safe and unsafe. As a result, the \{ZIP\} and \{ZINB\} are two models that have been applied to account for the preponderance of “excess” zeros frequently observed in crash count data. The objective of this study is to provide defensible guidance on how to appropriate model crash data. We first examine the motor vehicle crash process using theoretical principles and a basic understanding of the crash process. It is shown that the fundamental crash process follows a Bernoulli trial with unequal probability of independent events, also known as Poisson trials. We examine the evolution of statistical models as they apply to the motor vehicle crash process, and indicate how well they statistically approximate the crash process. We also present the theory behind dual-state process count models, and note why they have become popular for modeling crash data. A simulation experiment is then conducted to demonstrate how crash data give rise to “excess” zeros frequently observed in crash data. It is shown that the Poisson and other mixed probabilistic structures are approximations assumed for modeling the motor vehicle crash process. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that under certain (fairly common) circumstances excess zeros are observed—and that these circumstances arise from low exposure and/or inappropriate selection of time/space scales and not an underlying dual state process. In conclusion, carefully selecting the time/space scales for analysis, including an improved set of explanatory variables and/or unobserved heterogeneity effects in count regression models, or applying small-area statistical methods (observations with low exposure) represent the most defensible modeling approaches for datasets with a preponderance of zeros. },

  Abstract                 = {Ideal free distribution (IFD) theory predicts that animals in competitive situations should distribute themselves among available habitat patches according to the density of conspecifics and its regulatory effect on resources. To investigate the applicability of IFD models to free-ranging herbivores, we quantified the disper- sion and foraging behaviour of eastern grey kangaroos Macropus giganteus among habitat patches of differing suitability, within and outside a reservoir catchment in southern Victoria, Australia. Kangaroo densities within the catchment had a regulatory effect on resource density, while surrounding farmland maintained a higher standing crop despite higher densities of competitors. This difference was slight in autumn, however, when the system was apparently close to equilibrium. Gross bite rates of individuals foraging in farmland were lower than for individuals foraging within the catchment, and vigilance behaviour occurred more frequently in farmland habitat than any other, decreasing time devoted to feeding. Interference competition occurred in only 1.9\% of focal samples, although competitive differences based on phenotype were observed. Although resource gains by individual kangaroos are likely to be influenced by other factors, including resource dynamics, predation risk and phenotypic differences, IFD theory provides a valuable analytical framework for this herbivore foraging system.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have seen considerable progress in techniques for establishing relationships between accidents, flows and road or junction geometry. It is becoming increasingly recognized that the technique of generalized linear models (GLMs) offers the most appropriate and soundly-based approach for the analysis of these data. These models have been successfully used in the series of major junction accident studies carried out over the last decade by the U.K. Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). This paper describes the form of the TRL studies and the model-fitting procedures used, and gives examples of the models which have been developed. The paper also describes various technical problems which needed to be addressed in order to ensure that the application of GLMs would produce robust and reliable results. These issues included: the low mean value problem, overdispersion, the disaggregation of data over time, allowing for the presence of a trend over time in accident risk, random errors in the flow estimates, the estimation of prediction uncertainty, correlations between predictions for different accident types, and the combination of model predictions with site observations. Each of these problems has been tackled by extending or modifying the basic GLM methodology. The material described in the paper, then, constitutes a comprehensive methodology for the development of predictive accident models.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Vehicle collisions with wild animals are a serious problem that justifies the wide- spread application of mitigation measures such as road fencing and provision of cross- ing structures. Models that predict the best location for mitigation measures can improve wildlife survival and road safety. 2. A database of 2067 records of animal–vehicle collisions was used to create two data sets at different spatial scales. The first comprised records of road sections of 1 km length with high rates of collision in combination with road sections with a low number of collisions. The second comprised records of collision and no collision incidence at points on the road system at a 0·1-km scale. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between incidence of collision and measured habitat features in each data set. The models were validated with a subset of the original data not used in developing the models. 3. Road sections with high collision rates were associated with areas having high forest cover, low crop cover, low numbers of buildings and high habitat diversity. The fitted model achieved a significant predictive success during validation (χ2 = 4·82, 1 d.f., P = 0·028), with more than 70\% correct classification of cases. 4. Specific collision points typically had no guard-rails or lateral embankments, were not near underpasses, crossroads or buildings, and featured hedges or woodland near the road. The fitted model also showed a significant predictive power in validation (64\% correct classification, χ2 = 9·51, 1 d.f., P = 0·002) and accurately predicted 85·1% of collision points. 5. Synthesis and applications. Predictive models of animal–vehicle collision locations should be used at both a landscape level and a local scale during the process of road design and implementation of mitigation measures. Modelling of collision risk could inform decisions on road alignment and on the exact location of crossing structures for mammals, to improve wildlife survival and road safety. This is the first study integrating both landscape and local scales of analysis for the variables associated with animal–vehicle collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {Among linear facilities of transportation networks, highways are special because large-scale traffic and wildlife-fencing represent nearly total barrier effect for wildlife. Analysis of roadkill data provides information that helps to choose proper mitigation measures, both for traffic-safety and ecological aspects. Based on the roadkill database of the State Motorway Management Company Ltd., we evaluated data of the period between 2002 and 2009 of the Hungarian M3 highway of four selected species that are large enough to cause a threat to traffic safety (roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes)). Our aim was to describe spatial and temporal patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) and answer the following two questions: (1) does density influence road-related mortality and (2) does the presence of the underpasses influence WVC frequency of respective road sections. Roadkill data were summarized two ways: according to borderlines of the Game Management Units around the M3 highway, and secondly in 500-m- long segments of the highway. We observed the relation and calculated correlation between the frequency of WVCs and local density of these species. To do so, we used the National Game Management Database as source of estimation data of game populations. We did not find any strong and significant correlation between roadkill frequencies and estimated population densities. As a temporal evaluation, we analyzed the frequency of WVCs of each month. In each case, apart from the Eurasian badger, we found at least one month that differed significantly (p<0.05) from others. Based on our results, we believe that frequencies of WVCs are not predominantly determined by local density of the population. The importance of underpasses could not be clarified due to their probable relation to different habitat types.},

  Abstract                 = {Pond-breeding amphibians frequently encounter roads during their movements across the landscape to reach their breeding, summering, or hibernation sites. Through night driving surveys conducted each summer from 1995–2002 on a 20-km stretch of secondary road within a national park of eastern Canada, I evaluated whether road traffic had cumulative effects on amphibian abundance over this period. I also investigated the effect of nightly variations in traffic intensity on the number of amphibians killed on the road. I recorded a total of 4643 amphibian crossing events during the 37 surveys. I did not detect any decreasing trend in abundance for amphibian roadside populations over the 8 years. The number of dead American toads (Bufo americanus) increased with increasing traffic intensity. The number of ranid frogs (Rana clamitans, R. pipiens, and R. sylvatica) dead on the road was greatest when many individuals were moving on the road and at moderate traffic intensities (approximately 10–18 vehicles/h). In contrast, spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer) dead on the road increased with decreasing traffic intensity. The number of ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma laterale and A. maculatum) dead on the road, on the other hand, did not respond to traffic intensity. Nonetheless, results indicate that subtle variations in traffic intensity as those observed in this study (i.e., 5–26 vehicles/h) can increase mortality on the road for certain amphibian species. Future studies in landscape ecology should routinely consider measures associated with roads, such as the proximity and density of roads, when investigating amphibian abundance patterns in wetlands.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Change in the number of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) in the South Australian pastoral zone is related to rainfall and population size. 2. These relationships are used to assess effects of harvesting red kangaroos by predicting the change in the risk of population decline and explosion under a range of harvesting regimes. The predictions account for the combined influences of rainfall, density dependence and environmental stochasticity. 3. The method illustrates the importance of considering environmental stochasticity when assessing impacts, and how risk assessment may be used to assist wildlife management. Sustainable harvesting rates will be overestimated if environmental stochasticity is ignored. 4. Because of uncertainty about the response of the red kangaroo population to extremes of rainfall, it is difficult to be certain of the effects of harvesting red kangaroos. The relationship between rainfall and population size depends on the scale of observation. The previous year's rainfall is most closely related to changes in population size over the whole pastoral zone. Over smaller areas, summer and autumn is the most critical rainfall period.},

  Abstract                 = {The history of demand modelling for person travel has been dominated by the approach that has come to be referred to as the four-step model (FSM) (see Chapter 2). Travel, always viewed in theory as derived from the demand for activity participation, in practice has been modelled with trip-based rather than activity-based methods (as presented in Chapter 4). Trip origin–destination (OD) rather than activity surveys form the principle database. The influence of activity characteristics decreases, and that of trip characteristics increases, as the conventional forecasting sequence proceeds. The application of this modelling approach is near universal, as in large measure are its criticisms (these inade- quacies are well documented, e.g., by McNally and Recker (1986)). The current FSM might best be viewed in two stages. In the first stage, various characteristics of the traveller and the land use-activity system (and to a varying degree, the transportation system) are “evaluated, calibrated, and validated” to produce a non-equilibrated measure of travel demand (or trip tables). In the second stage, this demand is loaded onto the transportation network in a process than amounts to formal equilibration of route choice only, not of other choice dimensions such as destination, mode, time-of-day, or whether to travel at all (feedback to prior stages has often been introduced, but not in a consistent and convergent man- ner). Although this approach has been moderately successful in the aggregate, it has failed to perform in most relevant policy tests, whether on the demand or supply side.},

Modeling of accident risk relative to environmental characteristics could enable managers to plan the layout of new roads or determine optimal location of mitigation measures to reduce the number of accidents on existing roads. We analyzed position data providing road crossings from 67 global positioning system (GPS)- marked red deer (Cervus elaphus) and location data of 271 car killed deer within the home ranges of the GPS- marked red deer. We modeled collision risk as a function of speed limit, season, road characteristics, and habitat features. For a subset of the data, we tested if vegetation clearance along a highway reduced the collision frequency of red deer. The relative risk for DVCs increased with speed limit. We found a higher risk for DVCs during winter compared to the other seasons. Forest cover, distance to pasture, and terrain ruggedness substantially affected risk of DVCs. Road edge clearance reduced the frequency of DVCs, but the effect appeared in the winter season only with a decrease of 53%. Our study highlights that speed limit reduction and road edge clearance are both powerful mitigation tools to reduce the number of DVCs.},

  Abstract                 = {Roadkill is one of the most striking ecological problems related to roads and traffic. The Amami Woodcock, Scolopax mira, an endemic and endangered species on the islands of southwestern Japan, ventures out on roads at night, making it susceptible to becoming roadkill. In the present study, I investigated woodcock behavior on roads at night, trends in nighttime traffic at roadkill hotspots, and dates when roadkill occurred in the past on Amami-Oshima Island in southwestern Japan, to develop mitigation measures to prevent roadkill in this species. Woodcocks were abundant on roads when the moon was waxing; ,90% of nighttime traffic was recorded between dusk and midnight. These findings were consistent with the occurrence pattern of roadkill in the past, that is, roadkills occurred frequently during the first half of the synodic month when the waxing moon crosses the meridian from dusk until midnight. This pattern was obvious particularly in the breeding season (Feb–May). As a mitigation measure, drivers should be asked to reduce their vehicle speed on moonlit nights, particularly several days before the full moon in March, because this is the most vulnerable period for the Amami Woodcock. The present study revealed that the interplay of three factors (woodcock behavior, trends in nighttime driving, and lunar conditions) accounts for the seasonal, periodic, and temporal patterns of roadkill specific to this species. Because night activities of various animals are affected by phases of the moon, lunar conditions may have stronger effects on roadkill in a wider variety of animals than has been previously recognized. Taking lunar conditions into consideration would be important for better understanding of roadkill patterns in a wide variety of animals using roads at night.},

Field traffic data were collected from 40 out of 92 counties in Indiana. The selection of a county was based on population, state highway mileage, per capita income, and the presence of interstate highways. Three to four automatic traffic counters were installed in each selected county. Most counters installed on the selected road sections were based on the standard 48-hour traffic counts. Then, the obtained average daily traffic was converted to annual average daily traffic by means of adjustment factors. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to develop the model. There were quantitative and qualitative predictor variables used in the model development. To validate the developed model, additional field traffic data were collected from eight randomly selected counties. The accuracy measures of the validation showed the high accuracy of the model. The statistical analyses also found that the independent variables employed in the model were statistically significant. The number of independent variables included in the model was kept to a minimum.},

  Abstract                 = {Parameter estimation is a critical step in the use of any metapopulation model for predictive purposes. Typically metapopulation studies assume that empirical data are of good quality and any errors are so insignificant that they can be ignored. However, three types of errors occur commonly in metapopulation data sets. First, patch areas can be mis-estimated. Second, unknown habitat patches may be located within or around the study area. Third, there may be false zeros in the data set, that is, some patches were observed to be empty while there truly was a population in the patch. This study investigates biases induced into metapopulation model parameter esti- mates by these three types of errors. It was found that mis-estimated areas influence the scaling of extinction risk with patch area; extinction probabilities for large patches become overestimated. Missing patches cause overestimation of migration distances and colonization ability of the species. False zeros can affect very strongly all model components, the extinction risk in large patches, intrinsic extinction rates in general, migration distances and colonization ability may become all overestimated. Biases in parameter estimates translate into corresponding biases in model predic- tions, which are serious particularly if metapopulation persistence becomes overesti- mated. This happens for example when the migration capability of the species is overestimated. Awareness of these biases helps in understanding seemingly anoma- lous parameter estimation results. There are also implications for field work: it may be reasonable to allocate effort so that serious errors in data are minimized. It is particularly important to avoid observing false zeros for large and/or isolated patches.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The construction of a predictive metapopulation model includes three steps: the choice of factors affecting metapopulation dynamics, the choice of model structure, and finally parameter estimation and model testing. 2. Unless the assumption is made that the metapopulation is at stochastic quasi- equilibrium and unless the method of parameter estimation of model parameters uses that assumption, estimates from a limited amount of data will usually predict a trend in metapopulation size. 3. This implicit estimation of a trend occurs because extinction-colonization sto- chasticity, possibly amplified by regional stochasticity, leads to unequal numbers of observed extinction and colonization events during a short study period. 4. Metapopulation models, such as those based on the logistic regression model, that rely on observed population turnover events in parameter estimation are sensi- tive to the implicit estimation of a trend. 5. A new parameter estimation method, based on Monte Carlo inference for statis- tically implicit models, allows an explicit decision about whether metapopulation quasi-stability is assumed or not. 6. Our confidence in metapopulation model parameter estimates that have been produced from only a few years of data is decreased by the need to know before parameter estimation whether the metapopulation is in quasi-stable state or not. 7. The choice of whether metapopulation stability is assumed or not in parameter estimation should be done consciously. Typical data sets cover only a few years and rarely allow a statistical test of a possible trend. While making the decision about stability one should consider any information about the landscape history and species and metapopulation characteristics.},

The 95\% isopleth harmonic mean home-range size (mean = 62.3 ha) was the smallest recorded for female eastern grey kangaroos. No range encompassed all of the habitat types available in the study area, and the mix and rankings of habitats selected at this level varied amongst individuals when compared by compositional analysis with available habitats. Selection of habitats at the within-range level also varied among individuals and differed between night and day for many individuals, but not for the population mean. Individuals selected strongly for good foraging habitat within their ranges. In particular, grassy clearings were used by all individuals and were selected strongly by day, night or at both times.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is the first to report data on wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) in Wallonia, southern Belgium, characterised by one of the densest road network worldwide. With the collaboration of police we identi- fied 3965 accidents involving “free ranging animal” between 2003 and 2011. We observed that these ac- cidents with free ranging animals result in 13% of cases in injuries for the drivers or passengers, and in less than 1% of cases in fatalities (death). 78% of these casualties involve wild animals, among which wild boar take the largest part (39% ). During the covered period we observed an annual increase of WVC of 21%. For wild boar and red deer, this increase was significantly correlated with hunting statistics, used as an index of population density. The temporal analysis demonstrated an increase of WVC during night time with peak of accidents at dusk and dawn. Monthly distribution revealed the role of breeding, dispersal and hunting in shaping temporal patterns of accidents. Spatial analysis, focusing on wild boar, roe deer, red deer and red fox demonstrated clustering of accidents for all these species, until scale between 20 to 70 km. Mapping of accidents via Kernel density analysis permitted us to highlight areas with high risk of WVC risk. Our study suggests that the problem of car accidents due to wildlife is an increasing concern in Wallonia but results on spatial and temporal patterns should help for setting up mitigation measures in the most sensible areas. Moreover we suggest that police data source should be used for nationwide analysis and for comparison between countries.},

  Abstract                 = {Moose–vehicle collisions (MVCs) pose a serious safety and environmental concern in many regions of Europe and North America. For example, in the state of Vermont, one-third of all reported MVCs resulted in motorist injury or fatality while collisions have increased from two in 1982 to 164 in 2002. Our work used a MVC dataset from 1983 to 1999 in the Northeastern Highlands of Vermont (four major roads) to perform space, time and spatiotemporal analyses and guide future mitigation strategies. An adapted kernel density estimator was imple- mented for exploratory analyses to detect high density collision hotspots on roads. The kernel in space showed seven major density peaks which varied in magnitude and spread between roads. The kernel estimator in time for all roads showed an exponentially increasing trend with annual periodicity and a seasonal cyclic component, where the majority of collisions occurred from May to October. Spatiotemporal kernel estimation exhibited discontinuous density hotspots in time and space suggesting changing animal movement patterns across roads. We used an adapted Ripley’s K-function to test the hypothesis that MVCs clustering occurred at multiple scales in space, in time and in space–time combined. Statistically significant spatial clustering was evident on all roads at spatial scales from 2 to 10 km. A more consistent clustering in time occurred on all roads at a scale distance of 5 years. Similar to the kernel estimation, annual periodicity was also evident. Positive space–time clustering was present at small spatial (5 km) and temporal scales (2 years) indicating that where MVCs occur is also influenced by when they occur. In retrospect, using multiple road lengths, and the combined kernel estimation and Ripley’s K-function in time and space, provided a powerful methodology to study varying spatiotemporal patterns of wildlife collisions along roads. This can greatly assist transportation planners in identifying optimal mitigation strategies along specific roads, such as deciding on location and spatial length for permanent and expensive measures (e.g. crossing structures and associated fencing) versus less permanent and inexpensive structures (e.g. wildlife signage and reduced speed limits).},

  Abstract                 = {Human–wildlife conflicts like wildlife–vehicle collisions pose major challenges for the management and conservation of mobile wildlife in human-dominated landscapes, particularly when large species are involved. Mitigation measures to reduce risk of collisions may be based on information given by wildlife movement and collision data. To test whether movement and collision data indicate different spatiotemporal risk zones, we predicted year-around probabilities of road-crossings of GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;102), and compared them with spatiotemporal patterns of police recorded moose-vehicle collisions (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1158). Probability of moose road-crossings peaked in May, June, and between mid November and the beginning of January, i.e. during moose migration. Moose-vehicle collisions were more likely during autumn and winter. Comparing environmental attributes of crossing and collision sites showed significant differences. The likelihood of collisions increased with the abundance of human-modified areas and higher allowed speed, and was lower on forest roads. We found that animal movement data alone are insufficient to predict collision risk zones, while analyses of collision data alone overestimate the collision risk in certain habitats. Our findings suggest that higher collision risk is largely due to low light and poor road surface conditions rather than to more animal road-crossings. This suggests that efforts to reduce wildlife collisions should focus on driver attitudes and road conditions rather than animal movement, and any efforts to model the collision risk will require actual collision data, and not just movement data.},

  Abstract                 = {Deer-vehicle accidents (DVA) have become an important human safety concern in the United States, and few studies have focused specifically on urban areas. We used remotely sensed data, multivariate statistics, and a geographic information system (GIS) to quantify landscape factors influencing DVA in 2 suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, during 1993-2000. We determined DVA areas (n = 80) containing 22 roadkills and control areas (n = 80) containing 0 or 1 roadkill based on numbers of DVA within 0.13-km2 buffered road segments. The most important variables (based on Akaike weights) that differentiated between DVA areas and control areas were num- ber of buildings and number of public land patches. A logistic regression model containing these variables best fit the data and correctly classified 31 of 40 (77.5%) areas not used for model building. Local wildlife biologists and urban planners can use this information in managing deer habitat to minimize DVA by reducing forest cover and shrubby areas on public land near roads. We suggest that community officials consider using the potential for DVA as justification for proactive population and habitat management programs to maintain deer populations at levels that minimize deer-human conflicts},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the present study was to determine the yearly mortality level and identify the collision places of mammals on a road network with varying traffic volume, as well as to establish the main relations between habitat structure and the number of roadkills. During 26 months of survey on a 48.8 km road network (15 roads) with different traffic volumes (350– 10500 cars per 24 h) situated in an agricultural landscape of SW Poland 383 killed mammals of 23 species were found. The most abundant group were small rodents (40%), with dominant com- mon vole Microtus arvalis (26%) followed by in- sectivores (32%), topped by two species of hedge- hogs Erinaceus spp. (20%). The average (± SD) road-kills index during the whole study period on 11 road sections with the lowest traffic volume (350–460 cars per 24 h) amounted to 0.29 ± 0.14 (range = 0.08–0.56) casualties per 100 m. This value was over seven times lower than on the sec- tion with the highest (10500 cars per 24 h) traffic volume (2.13 casualties per 100 m). Over 80% of victims were found between May and October. During the whole study period 38% of victims were recorded within built-up areas, where 26% of the studied roads were localized. The other 62% were found on the roads situated in the open farmland (74% of all roads). The clear majority of hedgehogs Erinaceus spp., weasels Mustela niva- lis, brown rats Rattus norvegicus, beech martens Martes foina and red foxes Vulpes vulpes died within villages, while the animals killed on roads in the open farmland included all recorded com- mon voles, moles Talpa europaea and common shrews Sorex araneus. The decisive factor affect- ing the mortality level in mammals in the mul- tiple regression model was the daily vehicle traf- fic volume. This variable had significant, positive influence on the number of victims both within the most abundant species, their groups (insecti- vores, rodents, mustelids), as well as all mammals. The road location in the open countryside was an additional factor affecting the level of losses in rodents, while its presence in the built-up area increased the mortality of hedgehogs.},

In the second part, linear regression was practiced as an AADT estimation process, which was primarily based on known or accepted AADT values on the neighboring state and local roadways, population densities and other social/economic data. To develop AADT prediction models for estimating AADT values, two different types of database were created, including a social economic database and a roadway characteristics database. Ten years social economic data, from 1995 to 2005 were collected for each of the 67 counties in the state of Florida, and a social economic database was created by manually imputing data obtained from different resources into the social economic database. The roadway characteristics database was created by joining different GIS data layers to the Tele Atlas base map provided by Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Stepwise regression method was used to select variables that will be included into the final models. All selected independent variables in the models are statistically significant with a 90\% level of confidence. In total, six linear regression models were built. The adjusted R2 values of the AADT prediction models vary from 0.166 to 0.418. Model validation results show that the MAPE values of the AADT prediction models vary from 31.99\% to 159.49\%. The model with the lowest MAPE value is found to be the minor state/county highway model for rural area. The model with the highest MAPE value is found to be the local street model for large metropolitan area. In general, minor state/county highway models provide more reasonable AADT estimates as compared to the local street model in terms of the lower MAPE values.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Citizen science programs that record wildlife observations on and along roads can help reduce the underreporting of wildlife-vehicle collisions and identify and prioritize road sections where mitigation measures may be required. It is important to evaluate potential biases in opportunistic citizen science data. We investigated whether the opportunistic observations of live animals by volunteers along a 46-km section of Highway 3 in the Crowsnest Pass area (“Road Watch in the Pass” data collection program) in Alberta, Canada, had a similar spatial pattern as systematically collected data by the researchers along the same road section. A permutation modeling process that compared the number of observations between the two datasets for each 1-km segment, a randomization method that tested for and compared hotspot observation locations, and a bivariate Ripley's L1.2-function analysis along a continuum of spatial scales all showed spatial agreement between the two datasets. There was spatial agreement at a scale between 1 and 4 km, and three clear hotspots of wildlife observation activity were identified for both processes. This suggests that the data collected by the volunteers are reliable and robust enough to be used to help identify road sections that may require mitigation measures. In addition, volunteers proved to be able to collect a sufficient number of observations relatively quickly. Within one year, 24 volunteers collected 640 wildlife observations, and we found that using only 150 or more of these observations always resulted in spatial similarity with the systematic observations collected by the researchers. We conclude with recommendations for other citizen science data collection programs and for further research. },

  Abstract                 = {Roads have a significant impact on wildlife world-wide. Two of the ways to mitigate the impact of roads are to improve connectivity and reduce mortality through fences and wildlife crossings. However, these are expensive actions that will have different effects in different places. Thus, deciding where and how to act in order to achieve the greatest return on investment is crucial. Currently, there are no quantitative approaches to prioritize different road mitigation options. Here, we use a decision science framework to determine the most cost-effective combination of actions to mitigate the effects of roads on wildlife under budget constraints. We illustrate our approach using a case study of a threatened koala Phascolarctos cinereus population in south-east Queensland. We applied a spatially explicit population model to explore the benefits of three kinds of mitigation actions: no action at all and fences with or without crossings, on different road segments. We explored the trade-off between expected koala population size, relative to the best outcome, and budget. There is a strong demand for mitigation as the already declining population was reduced even further when no mitigation was employed, while applying the most cost-effective combination of mitigation actions minimized that decline. Additionally, uncertainty in species attributes (speed of crossing a road and population growth rate) affected population viability but not the decision about which suite of actions (mitigation measures) to take – so our advice on the best action is robust to uncertainty even if the outcome is not. Most importantly, the trade-off curves between investment and population size are almost linear in this case study. Hence, there is no cheap solution and any reduction in the budget will result in a substantial reduction in expected population size. Synthesis and applications. This is the first time that the problem of mitigating the effects of roads on wildlife was formulated mathematically and systematically using decision science. Our approach is adaptable to a diversity of species and systems affected by road mortality allowing flexibility for a range of mitigation actions and biological outcomes. Our method will allow managers and decision-makers to increase the efficiency of mitigation actions.},

Male and female mortality was generally similar; however, during December male mortality decreased while female mortality increased and during May and June there was an unexpected and unexplained increase in male mortality while female mortality remained essentially stable. The location of highway fencing was the most significant of the factors studied. Generally, high deer mortality occurred where the fence was located at the edge of a wooded area or within 25 yd (23 m) of the nearest wooded area. The lowest deer mortality occurred where the fence was located over 25 yd from the nearest wooded area. Low mortality also occurred where the fence was located within the woods. The effect of vegetation on deer mortality was significant only where fencing was absent.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a geospatial method to develop models to estimate annual average daily traffic (AADT) along a link with integrated spatial data from multiple network buffer bandwidths. The method incorporated spatial data that captured principles and statistical techniques to estimate directly AADT, and thereby bypassed the sequential four-step method. Spatial data (off-network characteristics, such as demographic, socioeconomic, and land use) captured from multiple network buffer bandwidths around a link were integrated with spatial weights that decreased as the distance from the link increased. Off-network and on-network characteristics were used as independent variables. The AADT calculated from field observations was used as the dependent variable. The applicability of Poisson and negative binomial distributions to the development of the models in a generalized framework for estimating equations was examined. A chi-square statistic test was conducted to validate the developed models and assess their applicability. The results indicated that the models based on the negative binomial distribution were more suitable than the models based on the Poisson distribution to integrate spatially varying data and estimate AADT. The maximum distance necessary to capture and to integrate spatial data varied by road functional class.},

  Abstract                 = {As an iconic and predominantly endemic Australian family of mammals, the Macropodidae are synonymous with Australia's faunal identity. Of the 53 species known prior to European settlement, six have since gone extinct and many more have suffered significant reductions in range and abundance. Although individual threats each take their toll (e. g. human modification of the landscape, hunting, the influx of invasive predators), it is the combined impact of multiple drivers of change that is of concern. This cumulative impact has the potential to expose even species typically considered common to extinction risk. Recent worldwide attention has been focused on the threat of roads to fauna, a threatening process now seen as a potential tipping-point for species struggling to survive. This chapter discusses what is known of the role that roads play in threatening species in the Macropodidae. It examines the direct and indirect effects of roads by collating published information of fatalities (road-kill), landscape modification and population persistence, contrasting impacts in urban and rural environments. It provides evidence that the impact of roads is more pervasive and potentially catastrophic for some species than previously thought, discusses attempts to mitigate the impacts of roads on fauna and explores the long-term conservation implications for the Macropodidae.},

  abstract  = {Roads and traffic have a multitude of impacts on wildlife populations. Wildlife existing within the confines of fragmented reserves are particularly susceptible to fatalities on roads, especially those situated within urban and semirural matrices. The sustainability of many wildlife populations within reserve fragments are tenuous as roads further subdivide reserved areas and increase the frequency of animal–vehicle contact. Although many studies have assessed the quantity and diversity of fatalities from collisions, few studies have examined the long-term viability of wildlife populations living adjacent to roads. We chose to examine the effects of disturbances, including fatalities on roads, on a population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) within the Royal National Park on the urban fringe of Sydney, Australia. Despite having an extensive range, researchers suspect that many local populations of this sole member of Wallabia are in decline. We used a combination of population modeling and sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of disturbances on the population. Under current conditions, the forecast of the population was to decline over the next 100 years with the possibility of becoming extinct. We found that female reproduction and breeding were most influential on the population model. Of the range of management options investigated, by far the most rewarding was the reduction of fatalities on roads, as only a 20\% decrease in female fatalities on roads has the potential to reverse the current decline and represents the best option for maintaining long-term viability. We suggest that documentation and subsequent management of road impacts, within the context of other threats, is essential to the conservation of similar species in road-affected environments.},

Aside from animal welfare and human safety considerations, fatalities may have signiWcant impacts on the population dynamics of species living adjacent to roads and thus can adversely aVect the viability of local populations. As such, the need to quantify and mitigate road-based fatalities is paramount. With a vast expanse of roads it is imper- ative to identify where animals are most likely to be killed (i.e. hotspots) and what are the contributing factors. In order to identify hotspots, we develop a modelling approach for both presence and presence/absence data. We use data collected from the Snowy Mountain Highway in southern New South Wales, Australia, to compare the eVectiveness of this approach for Wve species/groups of species. We observed that models of species killed in a clumped fashion were eVective at identifying hotspots, while for species where fatalities were distributed evenly along the road the models were less eVective. We recommend that where actual presence data exists spatial clustering is the preferred method of hotspot identiWcation. Predictive models of presence/absence date should be constructed if the intention is to extrapolate to additional areas. The added beneWt of predictive models are that they enable the identiWcation of explanatory factors and this knowledge enables species-speciWc management strategies to be developed and implemented at hotspot locations.},

  Abstract                 = {Models of kangaroo populations have primarily focused on the prediction of population growth and distribution in relation to environmental variation at broad geographic scales. Current understanding of small-scale patterns in distribution, habitat breadth, and niche occupation is less complete. A powerful model of dispersion is ideal free distribution (IFD) theory. In plant–herbivore grazing systems, the most appropriate IFD models are those that allow for the incorporation of a standing crop of resources. Using eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), we test the predictions of a previously described standing-crop IFD model where the number of consumers on a patch is proportional to the resource input rate, the standing crop of resources on all patches at equilibrium are equal (in the absence of interference), and the resource mortality rate is directly equivalent to the resource input rate, and is independent of the resource density (in the absence of interference). We make these comparisons at both the habitat and patch scale. At the habitat scale, we observed significant departures from these predictions that are consistent with the commonly reported occurrence of undermatching, whereas at the patch scale, little concordance with the predictions was observed. These results suggest that eastern grey kangaroos select for resources at the habitat scale but not at the level of the patch.},

We quantified differences among three foraging habitats and compared this variation to temporal patterns of habitat preference by free-ranging eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. We investigated selection on a fine-grained spatial scale, and asked whether habitat preference is constrained by density-dependent mechanisms. Variation in the quantity and quality of resources among habitats was greatest during spring, when biomass and quality were highest, and differences among habitats were most pronounced. However, consistent and discernable differences among habitats were not obtained, indicating that the system fluctuated around an equilibrium state. Using isodar regressions to examine the consumer-density relationships among habitats, open-woodland habitat was favoured over the two open-forest habitats for foraging. Seasonal isodars indicated that density dependence regulated preference between the three foraging habitats during autumn, spring and summer, but not during winter, when variability in resources among habitats was lowest.},

Often reserves possess many sealed roads that have regular traffic from tourists and local residents. As managerial bodies struggle to control the wide variety of threats to the fauna within these reserves, the loss of life on roads only compounds the precarious nature of wildlife survival in these dis- turbed environments. As a first step to addressing this concern in Australia, this study quantifies the fatalities of wildlife killed on roads within the Royal National Park in New South Wales, and estimates those wildlife species using roadside habitat in order to iden- tify species susceptible to collisions. Modelling of fatality data indicated that mammals were most likely to be killed where forage was abundant on the roadside verge and where there was plenty of protective cover, while birds were most likely to be killed when the height of roadside vegetation was low. A number of collision hotspots were identified along the surveyed road that should be the target of mitigation efforts. The average speed of vehi- cles travelling within the park peaked at night. This is of particular concern as activity by Australian mammals tends to be greatest at night. The findings indicate that roads in peri- urban reserves have the potential to alter the movement of animals and impact on their populations through loss of life.},

  Abstract                 = {Roads and vehicular traffic are among the most pervasive of threats to biodiversity because they fragmenting habitat, increasing mortality and opening up new areas for the exploitation of natural resources. However, the number of vehicles on roads is increasing rapidly and this is likely to continue into the future, putting increased pressure on wildlife populations. Consequently, a major challenge is the planning of road networks to accommodate increased numbers of vehicles, while minimising impacts on wildlife. Nonetheless, we currently have few principles for guiding decisions on road network planning to reduce impacts on wildlife in real landscapes. We addressed this issue by developing an approach for quantifying the impact on wildlife mortality of two alternative mechanisms for accommodating growth in vehicle numbers: (1) increasing the number of roads, and (2) increasing traffic volumes on existing roads. We applied this approach to a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population in eastern Australia and quantified the relative impact of each strategy on mortality. We show that, in most cases, accommodating growth in traffic through increases in volumes on existing roads has a lower impact than building new roads. An exception is where the existing road network has very low road density, but very high traffic volumes on each road. These findings have important implications for how we design road networks to reduce their impacts on biodiversity.},

  abstract  = {Protected areas are established to conserve biodiversity and facilitate resilience to threatening processes. Yet protected areas are not isolated environ- mental compounds. Many threats breach their borders, including transportation infrastructure. Despite an abundance of roads in many protected areas, the impact of roads on biota within these protected areas is usually unaccounted for in threat mitigation efforts. As land- scapes become further developed and the importance of protected areas increases, knowledge of how roads impact on the persistence of species at large scales and whether protected areas provide relief from this process is vital. We took a two-staged approach to analysing landscape-scale habitat use and road-kill impacts of the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), a large, widely distributed herbivore, within New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Firstly, we modelled their state-wide distri- bution from atlas records and evaluated the relationship between habitat suitability and wombat road fatalities at that scale. Secondly, we used local-scale fatality data to derive an annual estimate of wombats killed within an optimal habitat area. We then combined these two approaches to derive a measure of total wombats killed on roads within the protected area network. Our results showed that common wombats have a broad distribu- tion (290,981 km2), one quarter (24.9\%) of their distribution lies within protected areas, and the per- centage of optimal habitat contained within protected areas is 35.6\%, far greater than the COP10 guidelines of 17\%. Problematically, optimal habitat within pro- tected areas was not a barrier to the effects of road-kill, as we estimated that the total annual count of wombat road-kill in optimal habitat within protected areas could be as high as 13.6\% of the total NSW population. These findings suggest that although protected areas are important spatial refuges for biodiversity, greater effort should be made to evaluate how reserves confer resilience from the impacts of roads across geographic ranges.},

Location The Snowy Mountains Highway in southern New South Wales, Australia. Methods A binary logistic regression model was constructed using wombat fatality presences and randomly generated absences. Species-specific habitat variables were included as predictors in the model selection process as well as two spatially explicit measures of wombat habitat use. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed for each possible combination of predictors in R. The final model was selected by comparing all models subsets for the eight predictors and employing the one standard error rule to select the best model set. Results The final predictive model had high discriminatory power and incorporated both measures of species habitat use, greatly exceeding the variation explained by a previously published model for the same species and road. Main Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating variables that describe habitat use by fauna for predictive modelling of animal- vehicle crashes. Reliance upon models that ignore landscape patterns are limited in their capacity to identify hotspots and inform managers of locations to engage in mitigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Roadkills are amongst the most significant biodiversity impacts, although little is known about the factors which influence the roadkill of neotropical birds. Hence, the objective was to evaluate differences in roadkill richness and rates for neotropical birds according to the seasons of the year and habitat types associated with roads. The data was collected along two federal highways, in southern Brazil. We identified 57 roadkilled species, for a mean roadkill rate of 0.06&#xa0;ind./km/day (Min.&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009; Max.&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.47). Our results demonstrate that richness and roadkill rates change according to seasonality and habitat types. Roadkills were concentrated in rice fields and wetlands, intensifying both in richness and rates during the summer and autumn. Nearby areas have similar roadkill rates, independent of habitat types. This probably occurs due to the movement of several species seeking food and shelter. Juvenile dispersion, harvest and grain transportation periods, as well as flight and foraging behaviors over road lanes seem to be related to the increasing roadkill occurrences and richness regarding more abundant species. However, given the elevated number of occasionally roadkilled species (more than 70\% with N&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;5), we believe that highway surface and traffic act as physical barriers which inhibit the movement of many species which either present occasional roadkills or none at all. },

  Abstract                 = {Each year in Australia many thousands of collisions occur between motor vehicles and animals, resulting in considerable vehicle repair costs, injury to persons, and loss of animal life. This paper reviews animal-related road crashes in Australia and presents data from the in-depth Rural and Remote Road Safety Study in North Queensland for serious casualties (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;33) resulting from direct impact with an animal or swerving to avoid an animal on public roads. These crash types accounted for 5.5-percent of all eligible on-road serious casualties in the study and, hence, are considered to be an important issue that requires particular attention within rural and remote areas. Kangaroos and wallabies were the predominant species involved in these crashes (44.8-percent). Consistent with international studies, night-time travel was found to be a significant risk factor when comparing animal-related crashes to other serious injury crashes in the study. There were also a significantly higher proportion of motorcyclists (51.7-percent) than other vehicle occupants involved in animal-related serious crashes compared to all other serious injury crashes. Data matching to official Government records found underreporting of animal-related crashes to be an issue of concern. These findings are discussed in terms of countermeasures suitable for the Australian context and the need for consistent crash reporting across jurisdictions. },

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the extent of raccoon dog roadkills, and the factors influencing them, using data from the National Expressways in Japan for 1987–1998. A high rate of raccoon dog roadkills occurred in western Japan, whereas a relatively low rate was typical of the central region and of Hokkaido. Kills on the National Expressways increased as traffic and the length of the road network increased between 1987 and 1998. The relationship between mortality and traffic volume was scale-dependent. The number of roadkills was positively correlated with traffic volume at national level, but negatively correlated with the amount of traffic along sections of an individual major road between exits. There were spring and autumn peaks, and possibly early morning and evening peaks, of mortality. Mortality was higher for roads in a cutting, where the road was closer to water, and where the roadside habitat was broad-leaved woodland. Coniferous forest was negatively associated with roadkills. The total numbers of roadkills on four types of roads (National Expressways, National, Prefectural, and Municipal roads), was estimated to be between 110,000 and 370,000 in 1998. We suggest some preventative measures which might mitigate road casualties (while remaining attentive to human safety). Roadkill data, after controlling for traffic volume, can be useful as a population trend index. Patterns for racoon dogs are compared with those for other species. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: Despite its importance for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions, there is still incomplete understanding of factors responsible for high road mortality. In particular, few empirical studies examined the idea that spatial variation in roadkills is influenced by a complex interplay between road-related factors, and species-specific habitat quality and landscape connectivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we addressed this issue, using a 7-year dataset of tawny owl (Strix aluco) roadkills recorded along 37 km of road in southern Portugal. We used a multi-species roadkill index as a surrogate of intrinsic road risk, and we used a Maxent distribution model to estimate habitat suitability. Landscape connectivity was estimated from least-cost paths between tawny owl territories, using habitat suitability as a resistance surface. We defined 10 alternative scenarios to compute connectivity, based on variation in potential movement patterns according to territory quality and dispersal distance thresholds. Hierarchical partitioning of a regression model indicated that independent variation in tawny owl roadkills was explained primarily by the roadkill index (70.5%) and, to a much lesser extent, by landscape connectivity (26.2%), while habitat suitability had minor effects (3.3%). Analysis of connectivity scenarios suggested that owl roadkills were primarily related to short range movements (,5 km) between high quality territories. Tawny owl roadkills were spatially autocorrelated, but the introduction of spatial filters in the regression model did not change the type and relative contribution of environmental variables. Conclusions: Overall, results suggest that road-related factors may have a dominant influence on roadkill patterns, particularly in areas like ours where habitat quality and landscape connectivity are globally high for the study species. Nevertheless, the study supported the view that functional connectivity should be incorporated whenever possible in roadkill models, as it may greatly increase their power to predict the location of roadkill hotspots.},

  abstract  = {1. Animal–vehicle collisions are a serious problem for road planners and biologists concerned with traffic safety, species conservation and animal welfare. In Sweden, vehicle collisions with moose (MVC) are an important safety issue. Police records average approximately 4500 incidents year − 1 , including 10–15 human fatalities. New mitigation policies require improved knowledge of the factors influencing the spatial distribution of MVC. 2. Three logistic regression models were developed to predict MVC risks on public roads for use in strategic and project-related impact assessment. The models were based on remotely sensed landscape data, road and traffic statistics and estimations of moose density, quantified at 2000 accident and 2000 non-accident control sites in south-central Sweden. Model predictions were validated on 2600 1-km road sections in the county of Örebro, which were classified as either accident or non-accident roads. Model perform- ances were compared using Akaike’s information criterion. 3. Traffic volume, vehicle speed and the occurrence of fences were dominant factors determining MVC risks, identifying 72·7% of all accident sites. Within a given road cat- egory, however, the amount of and distance to forest cover, density of intersections between forest edges, private roads and the main accident road, and moose abundance indexed by harvest statistics, significantly distinguished between accident and control sites. In combination, road–traffic and landscape parameters produced an overall con- cordance in 83·6% of the predicted sites and identified 76·1% of all test road sections correctly. 4. Synthesis and applications. The risk of moose–vehicle collisions in Sweden can be predicted from remotely sensed landscape data in combination with road traffic data. Prediction models suggest that reduced vehicle speed in combination with road fencing and increased roadside clearance may provide effective tools for road planners in coun- teracting MVC. However, effective mitigation will depend on integrated management of the surrounding landscape and moose population, as well as increased responsibility of individual drivers. Remedying animal–vehicle collisions must involve road authorities as much as landowners and the public.},

  Abstract                 = {I studied trends and the spatial variation in ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC) in Sweden varying the spatial resolution in order to test the hypothesis that UVC are proportional to animal density and traffic volume. Spatial patterns were stud- ied at the level of individual hunting areas (N = 311), moose management dis- tricts (N = 95), and counties (N = 22), whereas trends in UVC were studied at national, county and district level covering periods of 30, 16 and 12 years, respec- tively. During 1970-1999 the overall number of reported collisions with moose Alces alces and roe deer Capreolus capreolus was closely correlated with changes in annual game bags and the increase in traffic volume. Large-scale spa- tial variations in UVC also showed a strong correlation with harvest and traf- fic. The ratio of collision numbers to harvest, however, increased significant- ly over time, suggesting a growing importance of traffic over ungulate man- agement. With increased resolution, other environmental factors such as pre- ferred habitat, road density and the presence of road underpasses that can pro- vide passages for wildlife, gained significance over ungulate density and traf- fic volume. My results suggest that the relationship between animal abundance, road traffic, mitigation measures and collision numbers are not linear. For future prediction, evaluation and mitigation of UVC in Sweden, improved knowledge about passage design, fence location, and the occurrence of UVC in time and space is needed.},

Results based on Euclidean distances are compared to those using network distances, and both allow for strategic spatial interpolation of count values while controlling for each roadway’s functional classification, lane count, speed limit, and other site attributes. Both uni- versal kriging and geographically weighted regression (GWR) are found to reduce errors (in practically and statistically significant ways) over non-spatial regression techniques, though errors remain quite high at some sites, particularly those with low counts and/or in less measurement-dense areas. Nearly all tests indicated that the predictive capabilities of kriging exceed those of GWR by average absolute errors of 3–8\%. Interestingly, the estimation of kriging parameters by network distances show no enhanced performance over Euclidean distances, which require less data and are much more easily computed.},

  Abstract                 = {This study recorded and analyzed cumulative vertebrate roadkill data on 107 km of roads in rural South Korea and reports the first intensive roadkill study results from Asia. Over 30 months, roadkill strikes and adjacent landscape factors were recorded daily or every other day on three types of roads: highway, local, and riverside. For analysis, roads were segmented into 250-m units, and roadkill hotspot segments were calculated with the Getis– Ord Gi* statistic. Eighteen road characteristics and land- scape factors were correlated to roadkill hotspots using multiple logistic regression analysis. Mammal mortality increased from spring to fall, whereas bird mortality peaked in summer. Reptile and amphibian mortality peaked during fall. Seasonal focal species’ mortality tracked the taxonomic groups they represent, except oriental scops owl (Otus scops), for which yearly mortality peaked 2 months earlier than for most birds. Mammal and bird roadkill hotspots were concentrated on the highway, which passes across mountains, whereas amphibian and reptile hotspots were on the riverside road because of movements related to breeding, juvenile dispersal, and hibernation. However, many species used the spatially complex agricultural fields along the local road, especially during harvest season. The significant site and landscape factors that influenced overall roadkill hotspots were a high landscape percentage of water and rice paddies, low traffic volumes, high percentage of natural vegetation, an absence of road banking, high roadside grass presence, and an absence of drainage. South Korea has an active wildlife- crossing management program, and these findings can inform avoidance, minimization, and mitigation strategies and practices.},

  Abstract                 = {Roads have numerous negative ecological effects on terrestrial fauna, and vehicular mortality can have significant demographic consequences for some species. We studied road mortality of reptiles around Carlyle Lake, Clinton County, Illinois, USA, from April 2000 through November 2002, to assess the impact of vehicular traffic and identify influential factors. Carlyle Lake, a popular tourism/recreation area, is situated in a larger agricultural landscape and is home to the largest Illinois population of the endangered Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus). We documented 321 cases of reptile road mortality (84 individuals of six turtle species and 237 individuals of nine snake species) while driving our approx. 46 km study route roundtrip daily. Turtle road mortality was highest in May and June, and positively associated with precipitation and minimum daily temperature. Colubrid snake road mortality was highest in April and October, and positively associated with minimum daily temperature. We recorded 42 cases of road mortality of S. catenatus with the highest number occurring from mid-August to mid-September. Road mortality in S. catenatus was biased toward adult males, which show an increase in movement in August, coinciding with the peak of the mating season and a period of high tourist visitation. The traffic intensity on a road segment did not significantly affect the level of road mortality, but segments through high quality habitats had higher levels of mortality than segments through lower quality habitats. Based on our study on the ecology of S. catenatus, we make recommendations to reduce road mortality that should aid in the conservation of the Carlyle Lake population.},

  Abstract                 = {(1) Food intake, grazing behaviour and diet of red and western grey kangaroos were monitored as they progressively depleted an arid zone pasture from 1000-1200 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> to an ungrazable residue. Food intake declined progressively over the trial for both species, but red kangaroos were better able to maintain their intake at low pasture biomasses. (2) Red kangaroos reduced the pasture to a residue of <20 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of halophytic chenopod subshrubs, but grey kangaroos were unable to reduce it below 180 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>; the residue consisted mainly of chenopods and the lily Bulbinopsis semibarbata. Both species preferred grasses and forbs over chenopods and lily. Red kangaroos harvested grasses, forbs and Bulbinopsis semibarbata at a significantly faster rate than did western grey kangaroos. (3) Red kangaroos responded to declining plant biomass and food intake by increasing grazing time by 0.5 h day<sup>-1</sup> for each 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> decrease in available vegetation. The grazing time of grey kangaroos was higher than that of reds from the commencement of the trial (13.8 v. 10.8 h day<sup>-1</sup> at 800 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), and less reactive to changes in pasture biomass. Females grazed for longer than males (14.6 v. 10.0 h day<sup>-1</sup> at 800 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). Grazing activity of both species peaked between dusk and dawn with animals spending >60% of their time grazing during this period. (4) The biting rate of kangaroos while harvesting and chewing food did not differ between species, averaging 56 bites min<sup>-1</sup>. Red kangaroos were significantly more mobile while feeding, taking more steps per minute and fewer bites per step. (5) Kangaroos appear able to harvest and process their daily food intake in substantially fewer bites than do ruminants. This may enable kangaroos to be more selective of food items, as they can devote more time to choosing each bite.},

In this case, the independent data set comprised 12 climate surfaces, that attempt to represent the range of temperature and precipitation important in determining the habitat of kangaroos across Australia. With this particular data set, the CART (decision tree) model was most accurate, but more time consuming to initialise. The relative performance of these models depends on the quality of the data set, and skill of the GIS analyst. Where possible, GIS analysts should implement all available methods, and compare output.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known of the impact of roads on insect mortality. This is a significant gap, because road verges are regarded as an important tool for insect conservation. In this study, we investigated which factors affect the number of roadkills in grassland butterflies and, simultaneously, the species composition and abundance on road verges. We established sixty transects, two hundred metres long, on roads in farmland areas and with differing traffic volume. Each transect consisted of two parallel lines, one on either side of the road. Ordination methods showed that the species composition of the butterflies killed on the roads was primarily explained by the species composition of those living on the road verges. At least 6.8\% of the butterflies were estimated to end up roadkilled. Also, the number of species and abundance of butterflies killed on the roads were positively dependent on both the abundance of butterflies on the road verges and on the traffic volume, but negatively correlated with the richness of plant species on the road verges. However, the proportion of individuals killed was negatively linked with the abundance of butterflies on the road verges, the richness of the plant species and the share of grassland in the landscape. There was a statistically significant tendency for small-bodied species to be overrepresented in the roadkill samples. Our results indicate that the verges which were of high conservation value for butterflies suffered the least from road mortality. The sowing of plant species, less frequent mowing and maintaining a high grassland cover in the vicinity of roads are recommended conservation actions for the improved conservation value of road verges for butterflies.},

  Abstract                 = {Conflicts from wildlife–vehicle collisions (WVCs) pose serious challenges for managing and conserving large ungulates throughout the world. However, underreporting of large proportions of \{WVCs\} (i.e., two-thirds of \{WVCs\} in some cases) creates concern for relying on governmental databases to inform management strategies of WVCs. Our objective was to test the sensitivity of \{WVC\} studies to underreporting using 2 species of large ungulates that experience substantial incidences of collisions but exist in different environmental settings: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in agricultural-dominated central Illinois and moose (Alces alces) in forest-dominated western Maine, USA. We estimated baseline relationships between the landscape, traffic, and abundance of wildlife on the probabilities of \{WVCs\} using the total number of reported WVCs. Then, we simulated underreporting by randomly excluding reports of \{WVCs\} and evaluated for relative changes in precision, parameter estimates, and prediction. Point estimates of the relationships between environmental influences and \{WVCs\} for both species were reliable until high rates of underreporting occurred (⩾70\%). When underreporting occurred with spatial bias, shifts in point estimates were detected only for variables that spatially-corresponded with the rate of reporting. Prediction estimates for both species were also reliable until high rates of underreporting occurred (⩾75\%). These findings suggest that predictive models generate reliable estimates about \{WVCs\} with large ungulates unless underreporting is severe; possibly because they occur in non-random patterns (i.e., hotspots) and variability in their environment influences is low. We recommend that concern about underreporting not impede research with existing databases, such as those in this study, for analyzing predictive models and developing management strategies for reducing WVCs.},

  Abstract                 = {{Imposing human perceptions about the scales of ecological processes can produce unreliable scientific inferences in wildlife research and possibly misinform mitigation strategies. An example of this disconnect occurs in studies of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). Subjective procedures are often used to delineate hotspots of WVCs, resulting in hotspots that are not spatially independent. We developed a new approach that identifies independent hotspots using attributes of the landscape to inform delineations instead of subjective measures. First, we generated a candidate set of grouping scenarios using unique combinations of kernel-density estimation parameterization (i.e., bandwidth and isopleth values). Next, we associated the groups of WVCs with attributes of the surrounding landscape. Finally, we identified the grouping scenario with the highest amount of variation in the landscape among the groups. The highest variation corresponded to hotspots that were most distinguishable from each other (i.e., most independent) based on the surrounding landscape. We tested our approach on 3 species of wildlife {[}island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) on San Clemente Island, CA; white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Onondaga County, NY; and moose (Alces alces) in western Maine] that exemplified varying degrees of space-use in different landscapes. We found that the landscape-based approach was able to effectively delineate independent hotspots for each species without using subjective measures. The landscape-based approach delineated fewer or larger hotspots than currently used methods, suggesting a reduction in spatial dependency among hotspots. Variation in the landscape indicated that hotspots may be larger than previously identified; therefore current mitigation strategies should be adjusted to include larger areas of high risk.}},

Densities of the eastern grey kangaroo, whiptail wallaby, red-necked wallaby and rufous bettong were higher; they were associated with a mosaic of grassland and open forest vegetation. Sightings of these species were sufficient to allow a detailed analysis of distribution and associations with environmental variables; their distributions did not vary seasonally. Of the three larger species, distribution varied within the day for the red-necked wallaby only.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Macropod communities are most diverse in eastern Australia. Patterns of macropod abundance along environmental gradients were examined from data collected on transects located in open forest, woodland, and pasture close to forest or woodland, throughout eastern Australia from latitudes 18–33°S. Nine species of macropod were recorded on the transects. Classification of the species by their abundance on transects grouped species in accordance with the latitudinal extent of their complete ranges. Three important environmental gradients were identified from 20 environmental variables measured at each transect: a climate–human influence gradient, contrasting heavily populated, temperate areas with sparsely populated, tropical/xeric areas; an elevation gradient, contrasting high, cold, sparsely vegetated areas with low, densely vegetated areas; and a physical–vegetation gradient, contrasting steep, rocky, densely vegetated areas with flat, sparsely vegetated areas. Most species showed significant variation in abundance across these gradients. Patterns of ecological separation of the species along the gradients are examined and discussed. Total macropod abundance, richness and diversity showed a unimodal pattern along the climate-human influence gradient, with low levels at the gradient’s extremes and high levels mid-way along the gradient. This pattern of richness and diversity is consistent with both productivity and structural diversity hypotheses. Abundance, richness and diversity varied linearly along the elevation and physical-vegetation gradients, with values increasing as elevation and slope increased. Variation in macropod abundance, richness and diversity along the physical–vegetation gradient may be related to shelter availability.},

We used walked line-transect counts to estimate the abundance of 3 large macropod species, the whiptail wallaby (Macropus parryi), common wallaroo (Macropus robustus), and eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus). The survey area encompassed 90\% of the range of the whiptail wallaby, 45\% of the range of M. robustus robustus, the mesic, eastern subspecies of the common wallaroo, and 20\% of the range of the eastern grey kangaroo. Our estimate of 739,100 (SE = 100,200) whiptail wallabies would be close to the continental population, as the survey area included most of this species' range and habitat. The estimated 688,600 (SE = 83,200) common wallaroos may also be a significant proportion of the total population of the subspecies M. r. robustus, as this subspecies is thought to be sparse in unsurveyed parts of its range. Eastern grey kangaroo abundance was estimated to be 1,835,800 (SE = 246,800).},

Relative risk of a DVC was greater on rural roads compared to urban roads, roads with traffic volume >120 vehicles/h compared to roads with ≤120 vehicles/h, and high and medium speed roads compared to lower speed roads. Our findings provide guidance for identifying risks of DVCs related to road attributes, and prioritizing management strategies in an objective manner to mitigate risk from DVCs.},

  Abstract                 = {Although vehicle-induced mortality of wildlife is well known on roads throughout Australia, few empirical studies describe the extent of this mortality or assess the potential effects on wildlife populations. We recorded 529 roadkills of 53 vertebrate species along a 100-km circuit of three major roads during 20 weekly surveys across winter, spring and summer. This equates to 0.3 road-kills km –1 week –1 or one road-kill every 3.8 km week –1 . The most frequently killed native species were the northern brown bandicoot (4 per week), the mountain brushtail possum (2 per week) and the Australian magpie (2 per week). These values are underestimates because our survey technique could not detect all road-kills and ~40% of those left on the roadside disappeared within 7 days. Detailed study of the local population of the brown bandicoot is needed to determine whether such a level of road mortality is sustainable. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether any of 10 road and landscape attributes were closely associated with the presence of specific groups of road-kills. Bandicoots were not associated with any measured attributes. Possums were more likely to occur along roads on mid-slopes and ridge-tops. Magpies were associated with roads on ridge-tops. Canopy-dwelling birds were more likely to be killed on 3-lane roads surrounded by dense vegetation. Road-kill surveys such as this are needed to identify species for which road mortality is unsustainable, to determine the influence on threatened species, and to identify important crossing points where road-kills are high. The frequency of road-kill of many ground-dwelling or arboreal mammal species in this study highlights the importance of impact mitigation by road authorities.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the increasing evidence of drastic and profound changes in many ecosystems, often referred to as regime shifts, we have little ability to understand the processes that provide insurance against such change (resilience). Modelling studies have suggested that increased variance may foreshadow a regime shift, but this requires long-term data and knowledge of the functional links between key processes. Field-based research and ground-truthing is an essential part of the heuristic that marries theoretical and empirical research, but experimental studies of resilience are lagging behind theory, management and policy requirements. Empirically, ecological resilience must be understood in terms of community dynamics and the potential for small shifts in environmental forcing to break the feedbacks that support resilience. Here, we integrate recent theory and empirical data to identify ways we might define and understand potential thresholds in the resilience of nature, and thus the potential for regime shifts, by focusing on the roles of strong and weak interactions, linkages in meta-communities, and positive feedbacks between these and environmental drivers. The challenge to theoretical and field ecologists is to make the shift from hindsight to a more predictive science that is able to assist in the implementation of ecosystem-based management.},

  Abstract                 = {Traffic accidents between cars and wildlife cause loss of lives, suffering and economic loss. Many studies have quantified the characteristics of accident sites, but factors affecting wildlife behaviour near roads and traffic are less explored. Hence, the mechanisms affecting animal movement and collision risks are poorly understood. Previous work suggests that roads and traffic may alter the behaviour of many animals, with temporal and spatial effects on daily movements, migration patterns and land cover selection. Here we analyze data from GPS-collared female wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Sweden to study factors affecting road crossings and traffic accidents involving wild boar. Our results show that wild boar cross roads in habitats mainly used for foraging. Avoidance of traffic results in few accidents at high traffic levels, causing most accidents to occur at intermediate traffic levels. A conclusion from this study is that wild boar appears to be able to make behavioural adjustments that reduce the risk of close vehicle encounters. Applications of these results for mitigating accidents between wild boar and vehicles involve changes in behavioural patterns of drivers and changes in farming practices close to accident prone roads.},

These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human–environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability. A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human–environment systems is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The movement of native herbivores onto agricultural land is a key management issue world-wide as they may compete with domestic livestock for pasture and contribute to overgrazing and soil erosion. Eastern grey kangaroos Macropus giganteus are viewed as a problem species in temperate south-eastern Australia, where high-density populations in reserves encroach on nearby farmland. 2. This study examined home range size and use in M. giganteus across different types of land use and in relation to population density and pasture availability. 3. Farmland adjacent to either radiata pine plantations or reserves supporting high- density populations of M. giganteus was subject to frequent incursions by kangaroos moving onto farmland to rest or graze. However, animals from reserves moved on average only 135 m onto farms. 4. Home ranges of M. giganteus were significantly smaller in the reserves than in farm study sites where population densities were lower. At reserve sites, home range size was limited by higher population densities and limited opportunity for dispersal across surrounding open farmland because of a lack of cover. Home range size was not affected by resource availability. 5. Where suitable vegetation cover occurred on farmland (e.g. woodland remnants or scrub), M. giganteus occurred as resident or roving small mobs. This may be seen by farmers as a disincentive to preserve remnant vegetation as it can provide habitat for unwanted native wildlife. 6. Home range attributes of M. giganteus suggest the species could be controlled by culling. However, recolonization occurs quickly and little is known of dispersal. 7. Synthesis and applications. Population density, presence of cover and reluctance to disperse across cleared landscapes are key factors influencing kangaroo home range size and use of adjacent farmland. Currently, little incentive exists for farmers to preserve remnant vegetation, as it may be regarded as providing habitat for unwanted or ‘pest’ kangaroos. Given the potential importance of remnant vegetation on private land for the conservation of plants and other species of wildlife, government incentives and compensation programmes may be required to limit land clearing on farms and to encourage improved pasture management.},

  Abstract                 = {Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) is a critical input to many transportation analyses. By definition, AADT is the average 24-hour volume at a highway location over a full year. Traditionally, AADT is estimated using a mix of permanent and temporary traffic counts. Because field collection of traffic counts is expensive, it is usually done for only the major roads, thus leaving most of the local roads without any AADT information. However, AADTs are needed for local roads for many applications. For example, AADTs are used by state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to calculate the crash rates of all local roads in order to identify the top five percent of hazardous locations for annual reporting to the U.S. DOT. This dissertation develops a new method for estimating AADTs for local roads using travel demand modeling. A major component of the new method involves a parcel-level trip generation model that estimates the trips generated by each parcel. The model uses the tax parcel data together with the trip generation rates and equations provided by the ITE Trip Generation Report. The generated trips are then distributed to existing traffic count sites using a parcel-level trip distribution gravity model. The all-or-nothing assignment method is then used to assign the trips onto the roadway network to estimate the final AADTs. The entire process was implemented in the Cube demand modeling system with extensive spatial data processing using ArcGIS. To evaluate the performance of the new method, data from several study areas in Broward County in Florida were used. The estimated AADTs were compared with those from two existing methods using actual traffic counts as the ground truths. The results show that the new method performs better than both existing methods. One limitation with the new method is that it relies on Cube which limits the number of zones to 32,000. Accordingly, a study area exceeding this limit must be partitioned into smaller areas. Because AADT estimates for roads near the boundary areas were found to be less accurate, further research could examine the best way to partition a study area to minimize the impact.},

  Abstract                 = {Several factors impede the collection of reliable data on railway-killed wildlife including the relative inaccessibility of railway-lines; the lack of experienced individuals to observe, identify, and record railway-kills; and the inherent difficulty of identifying and investigating railway-wildlife incidents from moving locomotives. As a consequence, data sets on wildlife mortalities along railways may not have sufficient resolution to define issues and suggest mitigation strategies. We examine these issues along the Mountain Subdivision of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) crossing the Rocky and Columbia mountains in eastern British Columbia, Canada. In this area, the CPR parallels the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) and either traverses or runs adjacent to a combination of protected landscapes (Glacier, Mount Revelstoke, and Yoho national parks) and multiple-use (provincial) lands. During 1993-98, we gathered concurrent data on railway-killed wildlife from a single experienced observer and a routine monthly reporting system (several observers). While the species composition identified by the 2 methods was similar, the experienced observer reports had better resolution to species and identified about 2x as many individual railway-kills. Using data from the experienced observer, we illustrated the non- uniform species-specific seasonal and geographic distribution of the railway-kills and the potential correlation of scavenger kills to ungulate kills. We list wildlife attracted to railway-kills and grain-spills and describe methods to reduce these attractants. Based on these observations, we conclude with 7 recommendations for consideration by jurisdictions and companies addressing railway-wildlife interactions: 1) concentrate mitigation strategies on identified problem areas; 2) develop an on-going training program for running crews to compliment wildlife reporting systems; 3) remove railway-kill carcasses from the vicinity of the right-of-way to reduce attraction to scavengers; 4) remove any spilled attractants (e.g., grain) in a timely manner; 5) reduce chronic grain spillage through car maintenance and handling procedures; 6) manage right-of-way vegetation to reduce attractiveness to wildlife; and, 7) share databases between jurisdictions.},

Data from California’s I-880N freeway in 2002 and 2009 and the I-5N freeway in 2009 were used. The crash risk models for these three datasets are quite different from each other. The model parameters do not remain stable over time or space. The transferability evaluation results show that the crash risk models cannot be directly transferred across time and space. The updating results indicate that the Bayesian updating approach is effective in improving both spatial and temporal transferability even when new data are limited. The predictive performance of the updated model increases with an increase in the sample size of the new data. In addition, when limited new data are available, updating an existing model is better than developing a model using the limited new data. },

  Abstract                 = {Classified mean daily traffic (MDT) is an important input for modern highway and pavement design methods. Using Bayesian decision theory, an algorithm for computing the probability of a match between a short count site, and each of a set of permanent counting stations showing distinct trends, was developed. Using vehicle classification data collected at long term pavement performance project (LTPPP) sites in Minnesota, this algorithm was tested, and a very reliable assignment was found using a 12 day sample, consisting of a one-day classification count from each month of the year, while ambiguous assignment was seen for simple two-day samples. In order to reduce estimation error arising from uncertainty concerning the correct adjustment parameters, a Bayes estimator of classified MDT was developed as a weighted average of the expected MDT given the sample and a set of adjustment parameters, with the posterior classification probabilities providing the weights. The effects of sample size, age of adjustment factors, and the sampling time on the accuracy of the estimates were studied. An evaluation of two-day classification count samples indicated that for estimating MDT by vehicle class, these samples should be taken between May and October, and between Tuesday and Thursday. In this case, the estimation error of Bayes estimates of classified MDT are about 10 +/- 12\% on average and within 26\%, 95\% of time.},

A study in which geographic information system technology was extensively used to investigate various factors that may contribute to AADT on a road is presented.

  Abstract                 = {Traffic count data are useful for many purposes, but often not available for significant portions of road networks. It would be prohibitive to cover all roads with traditional sensor-based traffic monitoring system, particu- larly for rural, low-class roads. In cases where traffic volumes are needed but unavailable, travel demand models (TDMs) can be used to estimate such information. A literature review indicates that research work for estimating traffic volumes for low-class roads using TDM is scarce. The majority of previous research used traffic count data-based regressions. The problem of such an approach is that it relies on available traffic counts to develop, calibrate, and validate regression models. Nevertheless, few or no traffic counts are collected on low-class roads, and therefore make it inapplicable. This study implements TDMs for two regions in the province of New Brunswick, Canada to estimate traffic volumes for low-class roads. Geographical Information System-based TDMs using census data and Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Quick Response Method produce forecasted traffic for a significant portion of road network previously without any traffic information and limit the average estima- tion errors for low-class roads to less than 40\%. Available traffic data were increased by 45\% in York County and 144\% in the Beresford area. The traffic estimation errors are comparable to or better than those reported in the literature, and the forecast traffic volumes provide a solid foundation for identifying high-volume road segments and prioritizing funding. Study results clearly show TDM is a practical, useful, cost-effective way for estimating traffic parameters on low-class roads.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on the New Development of Statistical Analysis in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Ecological Research, Guest Editors: Chong He and Linda Young The spread of invasive species is a long studied subject that garners much interest in the ecological research community. Historically the phenomenon has been approached using a purely deterministic mathematical framework (usually involving differential equations of some form). These methods, while scientifically meaningful, are generally highly simplified and fail to account for uncertainty in the data and process, of which our knowledge could not possibly exist without error. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for population spread that accommodates data sources with errors, dependence structures between population dynamics parameters, and takes into account prior scientific understanding via non-linear relationships between model parameters and space-time response variables. We model the process (i.e., the bird population in this case) as a Poisson response with spatially varying diffusion coefficients as well as a logistic population growth term using a common reaction-diffusion equation that realistically mimics the ecological process. We focus the application on the ongoing invasion of the Eurasian Collared-Dove. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

* Assessing the causal factors underpinning the distribution and abundance of wildlife road-induced mortality can be challenging. This is particularly ubiquitous for rare or elusive species, because traffic strikes occur infrequently for these populations and information about localized abundance, distribution and movements are generally lacking. Here, we assessed whether citizen-collected sightings data may serve as a low cost and efficient means of gathering long-term animal roadside presence and road-crossing information, which could then be used to assess the causative factors and direct mitigation actions aimed at reducing wildlife traffic strike frequency.


* We explored this principle using two decades of traffic strike records and citizen-collected sightings of the southern cassowary Casuarius casuarius johnsonii. Roads have bisected the cassowaries’ rain forest habitat and despite considerable investment into mitigation strategies for this species, road-induced mortality is considered one of the primary threatening processes affecting the population.


* Using a Bayesian approach and controlling for spatial autocorrelation with conditional autoregressive models, we demonstrate that traffic strikes are primarily a density-dependent process in the southern cassowary. That is, traffic strike clusters occurred along stretches of road where cassowaries were most frequently sighted. There were, however, road stretches where traffic strike frequency was greater than predicted by the number of roadside sightings, illustrating when and where density-independent processes increased the mortality potential for a road-crossing cassowary.


* Synthesis and applications. This is the first time that citizen-collected sightings data have been used to systematically inform upon the abundance and distribution of wildlife traffic strike. The technique not only predicts where incidents are likely to occur but also helps us to understand the factors responsible for strike clustering. While not a replacement for systematic surveys, we highlight citizen-collected sightings data as a low-cost option when assessing contributing factors to vehicle-induced mortality. Accounting for density-dependent and density-independent processes will ensure the most effective allocation of resources when implementing wildlife traffic strike mitigation.

These measures and the related indices, “true positive fraction” and “false positive fraction”, are more meaningful than “accuracy”, yet do not provide a unique description of diagnostic performance because they depend on the arbitrary selection of a decision threshold. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is shown to be a simple yet complete empirical description of this decision threshold effect, indicating all possible combinations of the relative frequencies of the various kinds of correct and incorrect decisions. Practical experimental techniques for measuring ROC curves are described, and the issues of case selection and curve-fitting are discussed briefly. Possible generalizations of conventional ROC analysis to account for decision performance in complex diagnostic tasks are indicated. ROC analysis is shown to be related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making. The concepts of “average diagnostic cost” and “average net benefit” are developed and used to identify the optimal compromise among various kinds of diagnostic error. Finally, the way in which ROC analysis can be employed to optimize diagnostic strategies is suggested."

  abstract = {To manage anthropogenic environmental change for the benefit of biodiversity, we must improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms and their environment. We have developed multiscale habitat suitability models (HSMs) for bats, a mobile group of mammals, for a geographically varied region of the UK. We ask whether the models have sufficient accuracy to contribute to informed decision-making in habitat management and in minimizing the impact of climate change and human infrastructural development.We used acoustic surveys supplemented by catching to gather presence data for eight species from 30 sites across the south of the Lake District National Park in NW England. Species were identified by manual and automated extraction and analysis of echolocation calls. Fine-resolution (50 and 100 m) habitat maps were generated at twelve spatial scales by calculating the variables across squares of increasing size, from 100 to 6000 m, around each focal 50 or 100 m square. Presence-only HSM software, MaxEnt, was used to determine the predictive power of each habitat variable at each scale. Multiscale models included data for each variable at the scale at which it had the strongest relationship with the presence of each species.The best multiscale models were selected using fivefold cross-validation, with backwards, stepwise variable removal, whilst minimizing residual spatial autocorrelation and sampling bias. Further tests with independent field data indicated good model transferability across the entire National Park.Foraging bats were generally most strongly associated with variables measured at small spatial scales and distance measures. However, each species responded differently across the range of scales, and strong associations were also found at the largest scale of analysis (6000 m).Synthesis and applications. The best models for determining habitat suitability had few variables, making them easy to interpret and use in practical conservation planning. The approach is applicable to any taxa for which reliable presence records are available, providing insight into the potential impacts of land-use and environmental change. Maps identify areas of conservation concern, such as hot spots for diversity, rare or vulnerable species and potential or threatened network corridors, making them useful for ecological impact assessment of proposed developments, and to conservation managers planning habitat creation or improvement.}

  abstract = {Under the effects of rapid environmental change, such as climate change and land degradation, assessment of plant species potential distribution is becoming increasingly important for conservation purposes. Moreover, land administrators need reliable predictions of species suitability for planning a wide range of management activities.2In this study, we used the recent Maxent algorithm for modelling the niche of Arnica montana within a Site of Community Importance in the Alps, with the ultimate aim of providing a rigorous evidence base for management of this locally threatened species. We built a final suitability map taking into account (i) the minimization of spatial autocorrelation through the use of a constrained random split of sampled data; (ii) the use of a stepwise selection of predictors in order to obtain a reduced model containing only meaningful variables; (iii) the comparison of the predictive power of three sets of environmental predictors; (iv) the identification of the most suitable areas by overlaying predictions of three competing models; (v) the use of divergence maps as a complement to conventional performance comparison assessments.3Maxent improved accuracy both on training and test data sets. Elevation, geomorphology and hosting habitats performed as effective primary predictors. A reduced model based on the outcomes of a preliminary stepwise selection analysis of predictors gave the best accuracy score on test data. Two parts of the study area have been selected for management as a result of areas of agreement between the three competing models.4Synthesis and applications. There remain important methodological issues that need to be improved in order to increase confidence in niche modelling and ensure that reintroduction and management activities for threatened or rare plant species are based on reliable distribution models. Modellers can improve predictions of plant distribution by addressing methodological topics that are often overlooked, as demonstrated for A. montana in this study.}

  abstract = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) are important in wildlife management due to their increasing socioeconomic impacts and pervasive effect on some endangered species. In this study, we depict the involved species and evaluate the geographic distribution and economic cost of this human-animal interaction in Spain. We used unpublished information on 74,600 WVC reported by police statements from 2006 to 2012. These collisions accounted for 8.9 {\%} of all reported road traffic accidents in the country. They were unevenly distributed, with WVC accounting for 30--50 {\%} of all road traffic accidents in some mountainous provinces in the north. Results show that wild boar (Sus scrofa) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), two abundant free-ranging ungulates (O. Artiodactyla) whose populations have expanded throughout Spain during the last few decades, were involved in 79 {\%} of WVC. These species were responsible for most economic losses and, in the case of the wild boar, for most human injuries. The number of vehicle collisions involving large carnivores (O. Carnivora) was small, with the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) present in most cases (70 {\%}). They included some endangered species (brown bear, Ursus arctos, and Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus). The results provide a reliable picture of WVC in Spain and provide the first assessment of the economic cost of this wildlife-human interaction (105 million {\texteuro} yearly).},

Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail.

  abstract = {Potential environmental impacts on wildlife result from siting and construction (short-term impacts) and habitat removal and fragmentation (long-term impacts) as a consequence of transportation corridor construction. Especially in rural districts, wildlife migration corridors and dispersal orientation are altered or destroyed and wildlife populations and their gene pools are isolated. This significantly weakens the wildlife community. Prudent selection of construction corridors reduces fragmentation impacts by maximizing preserved fragment sizes, and by running parallel to, not through, natural areas. Corridor width determines the degree to which wildlife movement is restricted except that culverts, underpasses, overpasses, and one-way gates, can aid wildlife in cross movements. Minimum underpass dimensions for large wildlife should be no smaller than 14 ft{\texttimes}14 ft and should include natural substratum inverts. Rail corridors have four characteristics that minimize adverse environmental impacts. The railbed is dry, ballast fillters runoff, there is little runoff beyond the toe of slope, and drainage ditches serve to control sheet flow and erosion, sediment movement, and uncontrolled channel flow. Rail corridors usually occupy smaller land areas because they are narrower and are more feasible to elevate so as to allow free movement of wildlife across the corridor.},

  abstract  = {The use of species distribution models to understand and predict species' distributions necessitates tests of fit to empirical data. Numerous performance metrics have been proposed, many of which require continuous occurrence probabilities to be converted to binary ‘present or absent’ predictions using threshold transformations. It is widely accepted that both continuous and binary performance metrics should be independent of prevalence (the proportion of locations that are occupied). However, because these metrics have been mostly assessed on a case-specific basis, there are few general guidelines for measuring performance.Here, we develop a conceptual framework for classifying performance metrics, based on whether they are sensitive to prevalence, and whether they require binary predictions. We use this framework to investigate how these performance metric properties influence the predictions made by the models they select.A literature survey reveals that binary metrics are widely employed and that prevalence-independent metrics are used more frequently than prevalence-dependent metrics. However, we show that prevalence-dependent metrics are essential to assess the numerical accuracy of model predictions and are more useful in applications that require occupancy estimates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in comparison with continuous metrics, binary metrics often select models that have reduced ability to separate presences from absences, make predictions which over- or underestimate occupancy and give misleading estimates of uncertainty. Importantly, models selected using binary metrics will often be of reduced practical use even when applied to ecological problems that require binary decision-making.We suggest that SDM performance should be assessed using prevalence-dependent performance metrics whenever the absolute values of occurrence predictions are important and that continuous metrics should be used instead of binary metrics whenever possible. We thus recommend the wider application of prevalence-dependent continuous metrics, particularly likelihood-based metrics such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), to assess the performance of presence–absence models.},

  abstract  = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as the AUC, is currently considered to be the standard method to assess the accuracy of predictive distribution models. It avoids the supposed subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability derived scores are converted to a binary presence–absence variable, by summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

We firstly discuss the economic definition of HSR, trying to identify its different development and operating models. Then, we provide what could be considered as a range of actual cost values of building and maintaining a high-speed rail infrastructure. A similar analysis is carried out regarding the operating and maintenance costs of high-speed rail services. Some information on external costs is also provided. We finally deal with current demand and its projections, and try to draw some inferences about its future evolution. },
