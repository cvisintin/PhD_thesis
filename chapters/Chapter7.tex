\section{Synthesis of work}

In this thesis, I presented a modelling framework for determining wildlife-vehicle collision risk that can be used across taxa and locations. Drawing on well-established concepts of road ecology and risk theory, this conceptual framework is the first of its kind to address the disparate factors that contribute to wildlife mortality on roads. \cite{clev15} has recently identified this critical need in the discipline of road ecology. Perhaps the most useful extension to previous collision modelling work is the grouping of predictors that influence wildlife-vehicle collision risk into two categories that more directly relate to management activities. Most mitigation measures used by transport managers control either animal presence on a transportation network (e.g. fencing) or the operation of vehicles (e.g. speed) \citep{glis09}.  Using species occurrence to represent exposure and traffic volume/speed to represent hazard creates variables that can be more readily interpreted (see \Cref{egk_framework}). Further, all other predictors used in past wildlife-vehicle collision modelling may be incorporated into the sub-models in each respective group, thereby reducing uncertainty about potentially confounding effects. From this simplified conceptual framework, managers can compare the relative influences of exposure and hazard, as well as the uncertainties of each one. If costs of mitigation are known for each category, the conceptual framework is useful for performing cost-benefit analyses -- this was explored in \Cref{sec:train}.

Another useful development, applicable to previous work that uses generalised linear regression to model wildlife-vehicle collisions, is the choice of link function. This thesis is the first study to employ the use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) link function for modelling wildlife-vehicle collision events. This is important because the choice of a link function has theoretical underpinnings which are normally based on assumptions about how events arise in a system. I used the cloglog link as it assumes that collisions arise from a Poisson process which is reasonable for collision events occurring over a domain bounded by time. Another attractive feature of the cloglog is that it is not influenced by the choice of sampling area and model predictions can be re-scaled because the cloglog is based on predicting the rate of collision (per unit time, and per unit area). This made it possible to compare parameter estimates for models using different spatial scales. In contrast to several other studies that use a logit link \citep[i.e. logistic regression, see ][]{seo15,gund98} which imply strong spatial assumptions (e.g. the choice of sampling area does not influence estimates of model parameters and that model results can be compared between surveys with different spatial scales), this thesis demonstrated a robust and flexible modelling method that will enhance new and existing road ecology work. Moreover, these modelling methods are also applicable to other research involving ecological risk as discussed further in \Cref{other_threats}.

Beyond demonstrating the broad utility of the conceptual framework, my thesis also highlighted three key results. First, higher speeds of moving vehicles was a considerable hazard for wildlife having access to roads or railways. \Cref{sec:6sp,sec:cal} demonstrated similar patterns of collision risk with respect to traffic speed for seven mammals. Nearly all species had rising marginal increases in risk with increasing speed. Collision risk also increased exponentially with increasing train speed (\Cref{sec:train}), suggesting this phenomenon is not isolated to road networks. These results were consistent with the broader literature on wildlife-vehicle collision analysis, and also other collision analyses involving pedestrians and vehicles \citep{rosen09} and only vehicles \citep{liu97}. As mitigation to reduce animal proximity to, or exclude entirely from, transportation networks is costly \citep{huij09}, these results suggest that enforced speed reductions may be a more viable option for reducing collision risk; albeit not necessarily ideal for motorists wanting quick travel times. The conceptual framework I have developed in this thesis is able to assist managers to target specific areas for speed reductions and also simulate the effects from these proposed mitigations. Further, the predictions of risk from the conceptual framework may be used by technology to influence motorist behaviour (e.g. voluntary speed reductions) in areas, or at times, of high risk.

Second, temporal variation was important to incorporate into models that predict collision risk. Both animal and human activities have distinct patterns that correspond to time. In \Cref{sec:train}, I introduced a function into the model framework that accounted for cyclical patterns of animal activity at the hourly scale. This was a statistically significant variable and useful for extending predictions of risk from the spatial domain to the spatio-temporal domain. Temporal variation is rarely accounted for in predictive modelling of wildlife-vehicle collisions \citep[but see][]{beau10,gund98,neum12}. The function used in \Cref{sec:train} generalises to any species, contrasting with existing work that only characterises expected activity patterns for single species. Further, the function also used sunrise and sunset times (relative to geographic location) to consider time of day with respect to ambient light -- daylight being a factor known to influence animal activity.

Uncertainty is one reason that modellers who analyse collisions may be reluctant to utilise fine resolution temporal data (e.g. hourly scale). Indeed, all of the collision data used in \Cref{sec:egk,sec:6sp,sec:cal,sec:val} had temporal information at an hourly scale, however, differences between actual collision times and reported collision (or carcass collection) times were difficult to determine. Due to this uncertainty, I chose to exclude this data for modelling and prediction on the road networks. Patterns were evident from the histograms of reported collisions for all six species (\Cref{temporal_all}) and suggested temporal components may be useful for modelling and predicting collisions if the uncertainty can be reduced or accounted for. In contrast, the data used in \Cref{sec:train} had a high degree of certainty around the collision times reported by the train drivers. This was likely due to the systematic (i.e. standardised forms) and procedural (i.e. obliged to report collisions) nature of train operations. Reporting of road collision events are not subject to the same stringencies thereby making it more necessary to document uncertainty in the data and represent it in the modelling. One strategy would be to model both the collision events and the reporting. To do this would require some collateral data to help calibrate possible temporal variation in reporting rate so that the pattern of temporal variation in collisions could be elucidated. Precedents exist in ecology, such as state-space models that consider both biological processes and observation processes and account for biological stochasticity and measurement error. These include occupancy detection models \citep[e.g. ][]{mack02} and models of population dynamics that include imperfect observation \citep[e.g. ][]{mack09}.

Lastly, collision models and predictions are likely to benefit from increases in data quantity and quality. \Cref{sec:val} introduced the first known study in the discipline of road ecology to compare the effects of combining data from different data sources on collision risk modelling and predictions. This complements work that evaluates the use of citizen science to collect collision data \citep{paul14, dwye16}, and proposes technological advances for collecting data \citep{olso14}. Moreover, these studies call for the development of a centralised data storage system to improve road ecologists' understanding of where and when collisions occur. As demonstrated in \Cref{sec:val}, as more disparate collision datasets were combined together, model performance and calibration improved. Prospects for centralising collision data are discussed in a subsequent section. 

\section{Benefits of spatial modelling}

Most, if not all, environmental problems occur in a geographic context. Therefore, research involving ecological phenomena and issues often involves spatial analyses and outputs; such as species distribution modelling \citep[e.g.][]{elit09}. The use of spatial modelling in this thesis was fundamental to its intended purpose -- to represent collision risk across large transportation networks. Further, the use of spatial modelling in this work also supports its future application as a decision support tool for management or public outreach.

%\subsection{Access to spatial data}

Currently, there is a remarkable amount of publicly-accessible spatial data available on the Internet \citep{ma15} and it is reasonable to expect increases in future years. Data derived by scientific or government organisations often include additional metadata that detail reliability and data-generating procedures. In this thesis, nearly all of the predictor data used in modelling were derived from the public domain. This allows methods to be reproducible and transferable; for example, I developed several of the predictors in \Cref{sec:cal} using the same source of satellite-derived data (see \Cref{apx:C}) but for different geographic locations.

%\subsection{Spatial analysis in management}

The use of geographic information systems (GIS) to catalogue and view spatial features is widespread in management. Contemporary versions of these software applications incorporate functionality to perform spatial analyses. As most managers are familiar with spatial data, I employed spatial methods in this thesis that would easily integrate into GIS software. For example, all computer code was written in \textit{R} \citep{rdct16}, statistical software that can be called to perform operations on spatial data from within programs such \textit{QGIS} (www.qgis.org). Further, I developed computer code to convey collision risk as outputs that managers would be able to most readily utilise (e.g. maps). Generalised methods for analysing and predicting wildlife-vehicle collisions have not been available in road ecology and, therefore, systems to support management have not been developed. Moreover, some tools that have been proposed for analysing collisions utilise proprietary software and therefore limit potential uptake and use. Open-source applications (that interface well) are essential to maximise the availability of methods to management organisations. This broad reach will make the analysis of wildlife-vehicle collision more accessible, potentially creating a larger impact on the problem.

%\subsection{Communication and public outreach}

Conveying spatial information is an effective communication tool \citep{king00}; humans respond to visual stimuli. Most of the general public is familiar with geographic information through daily exposure to maps and other spatial data. Spatial data and analyses are natural candidates for data visualisation \citep{osul14}, a technique used to communicate information through the use of visual objects, and may increase public engagement through interactive content. Although the spatial outputs included in this thesis are static, the methods used to create them are easily adaptable to interfaces that enable users to perform analysis on collision risk by varying model parameters.

\section{Limitations of models and caveats}

Models are simplified abstractions of reality and therefore subject to error \citep{burg05}. Models are also useful as conceptual tools for organising complex problems and supplementing decision-making. However, care must taken when using models; although they may be internally logical, models are only as good as the assumptions, data, and specifications they are based on. Management decisions based on inferences from a mis-specified model or a model trained on poor data can have negative consequences (e.g. ineffective outcomes or costs). \cite{levi66} asserts that models can only be built to maximise two of three characteristics, namely generality, realism, and/or precision. The primary intent of the conceptual model framework introduced in this thesis was to maximise generality, or applicability to any ecological issue involving threats to wildlife (from humans and related hazards, e.g. use of vehicles). The model also exhibits realism in its theoretical treatment of collisions resulting from the coincidence of animals and moving vehicles in space and time. Much of the literature in road ecology that focuses on collision modelling operates on this assumption \citep{form03,guns11}, but does not make this explicit in the modelling methods. Therefore, it is difficult to draw inferences from the models to directly support management. High collision risk may be predicted with variables that are not logically related to collisions, such as tree cover. Further, by characterising risk as the combination of distinct components, uncertainty is easier to incorporate and analyse in models. 

One strategy to explore model uncertainty is to perform collision modelling analyses using Bayesian inference, which allows prior information to be incorporated into a model \citep{mcca07}. Prior information (or prior probabilities) weight the influence of data in a model (likelihood) to produce posterior probabilities. With respect to the work presented in the thesis, this may involve using expert opinion to provide judgement on the reliability of the predictions from the sub-models. For example, I had experts in macropod ecology examine the distribution of kangaroos predicted by the species occurrence model. Although there were some minor discrepancies, the overall patterns were realistic. However, since managers may base decisions about mitigation on the relative strength of exposure (animal presence) or hazard (vehicle movement), it is important to represent the relative confidence about each predictor in the model. Bayesian analysis also estimates all model parameters (coefficients and predicted values) as probability distributions thereby allowing further scrutiny of uncertainty. Credible intervals around predictions allow managers to make decisions from either a `risk averse' or `risk inclined' standpoint by using higher or lower values, respectively. 

The data used to train the collision model in this thesis are referred to as `presence-only' data which require special assumptions and treatments \citep{wart13}. True prevalence is not able to be inferred from presence-only data without a systematic and exhaustive search of the entire spatial domain with 100\% detectability -- if absences were recorded, this would become `presence-absence' data \citep[see][]{hast13}. Thus, the conceptual model in this thesis makes assumptions about prevalence based on the selection of background data (used to represent road segments where no collisions occurred). In this respect, predictions from the models are relative to reporting rates, as opposed to absolute.  In \Cref{sec:egk}, I randomly selected background data that was equivalent to twice that of reported collisions resulting in predictions that represented a higher relative rate of collisions on road segments. Although this is still informative for ranking road segments based on relative risk, the risk is not directly comparable to total reported collisions across the entire network. In contrast, \Cref{sec:6sp,sec:cal,sec:train,sec:val} all use the entire set of linear segments without reported collisions as background sets. In these cases, the models will predict reported collision rates, but actual collision rates will be higher, depending on the degree to which collisions remain unreported. A particular special case may be in \Cref{sec:train} where the reporting rates were assumed to be quite good and, therefore, the modelling dataset may better reflect of true collision rates.

Another potential issue of presence-only data is sample selection bias which refers to the manner in which data are collected and reported \citep{phil09}. In a spatial context, this may bias model predictions by over-representing and under-representing collision risk due to patterns of reporting, such as proximity to urban areas. Recent work in species distribution modelling has suggested the utility of spatial and temporal cross-validation for improving model performance \citep{weng12,robe17}. These methods have important implications for reducing bias and ensuring the generality of model predictions. The work in this thesis does not incorporate these methods, however, doing so would improve the analysis and resulting outputs.\vfill

\section{Novel future research}

In this thesis I presented several methodological advances not employed in previous wildlife-vehicle collision research, but also identified several important areas for future developments. Species traits, such as body size, are becoming increasingly employed in mechanistic modelling to predict species niches \citep{kear09}, and also  inform potential prediction errors \citep[e.g.][]{seoa05}. Although risk rates did not perfectly correspond to mammal sizes in \Cref{sec:6sp}, body size may influence reporting rates as smaller species are less likely to be observed, and potentially reported, due to reduced detectability and faster rates of decay or predation. Body size can also play a role in susceptibility to collisions based on movement speed \citep{jaar06} or visibility to motorists. Body size could be included in the collision model as an additional \textit{exposure} term, however, care must be taken when interpreting results due to potential confounding effects. For example, small body size may cause the animal to be more difficult to see by motorists and/or reduce road crossing time. Species behaviour may also influence exposure to wildlife vehicle collisions, such as flight response to vehicles \citep{deva14,lee10} or feeding patterns (e.g. near roads). As with species traits, this information can be used as an additional exposure term. In road ecology, there are very few studies that compare predicted risk between species based on traits or behaviour \citep[but see][]{litv08}. As such, this could be a potentially powerful extension of the work presented in this thesis. 

In a similar manner, incorporating additional characteristics of perceived threats (hazards) into the risk model is also useful. In this thesis, I represented hazard as the frequency and speed of vehicles across transportation networks. Only passenger vehicles were considered in the analysis, however, freight transport comprises approximately 20\% of road usage \citep{abs16}. Large trucks have considerable momentum and reduced stopping distances and are, therefore, potentially more threatening. One novel extension of the model would be to represent hazard with kinetic energy calculated by combining all masses and velocities of objects on each road segment. General collision risk literature has made use of this concept \citep{aart06}, but road ecology has yet to apply it to wildlife-vehicle collision modelling.

The work in this thesis models risk exclusively for common species, which raises the question of whether the methods are also applicable to rare species. Indeed, this would be an important feature for managers, and also more directly support conservation efforts. The theory underpinning the modelling framework enables analysis irrespective of species commonality, however, a primary difficulty is obtaining adequate amounts of data with which to train the models. Additional research that uses the framework to compare model performance between rare species and more common surrogate species, collected using a small targeted study, would be useful. If the results are deemed comparable, extrapolating to other areas where data on the surrogate species are available but data on rare species are more deficient would improve wildlife-vehicle collision modelling, prediction, and management. This may involve the use of population viability analysis which helps to understand changes in species persistence due to threatening processes \citep{rhod14}. Although a few wildlife-vehicle collision modelling studies have addressed conservation of rare or endangered species \citep{dwye16}, none have explored the use of surrogate species to suggest risk to rare species. This strategy has established utility in conservation biology \citep{caro99} and ecological modelling \citep{weng08}.

Several concepts in wildlife-vehicle collision modelling parallel those used in pedestrian-vehicle collisions, a vastly broader literature. One common feature is that activity patterns of humans and animals are quite important in determining when and where collision risk may be high \citep{mira11,lao11}. For the reasons discussed previously, the analysis in \Cref{sec:egk,sec:6sp,sec:cal,sec:val} only included spatial patterns and disregarded temporal variation altogether. However, \Cref{sec:train} demonstrated the utility of accounting for both spatial and temporal patterns of animal activity. Future collision modelling work would benefit from additional development of sub-models that simulate the motion of animals \citep[see][]{jaar07} -- borrowing concepts from pedestrian-vehicle collision literature \citep[see][]{lohn10}.

\section{Generalising to other threats to wildlife}\label{other_threats}

The conceptual framework developed in this thesis may be used to analyse risk for other human-wildlife interactions, thereby increasing its potential contribution to other environmental research questions. Its modular nature allows analysis of other adverse risks to wildlife (\Cref{gen_framework}) by replacing the hazard component with an alternative threatening process of interest, such as attacks from introduced predators or human poaching. Further, the exposure of species to hazards may be represented by data generated by alternative models; for example, movement patterns from connectivity analyses \citep[e.g.][]{mcra08} or local abundances from population viability analyses \citep[e.g.][]{beis02}. \cite{baud13} used a similar approach to determine collision risk between seafaring vessels and manatees, although did not emphasise the generality in their approach.

\end{figure*}

The modularity of the conceptual framework in this thesis allows possibilities for future research projects. Any human-wildlife conflict can be conceptually framed to analyse risks to wildlife from humans, risks to humans from wildlife, or both. Examples from \Cref{hmi_diagram} in \Cref{sec:intro}, and others, are listed in \Cref{hmi_risk}.

\section{Potential applications of research}

In an effort to maximise potential applications of this work to reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions, I have utilised publicly-accessible predictor data and open-source software tools, and developed reproducible computer code (\Cref{apx:A}). This allows the methods to be used for developing additional resources to supplement management and engage the public. Given these qualities, there are several foreseeable future extensions of this work. 

\subsection{Centralised data collection and reporting system}

Beyond offering incredible global interconnectedness, the information age has been marked by a massive amount of data generation that is publicly-accessible via Internet portals. One example is atlases of species occurrence data, such as the global biodiversity information facility (www.gbif.org), which holds nearly three-quarter of a billion records worldwide. Risk analysis to reduce human-wildlife conflicts would benefit tremendously from the creation of an open-access, single-source repository of wildlife-vehicle collision records. Worldwide, wildlife-vehicle collision data are collected by governments, private-sector corporations, non-profit organisations, community groups, and individual citizen scientists. This information is stored in several different formats (e.g. electronic or hard copy) and rarely made publicly-accessible. Collision data that are made available through world-wide web portals are often read-only and do not provide access to detailed spatial information; often this is due to propriety or concerns about public use of unwarranted data.

I propose a centralised data system that not only catalogues collision records and metadata, but also provides other important functions (\Cref{wvc_server}). The system communicates with other data systems and external applications (shown in green and red, respectively, in \Cref{wvc_server}). This includes interfacing with existing data repositories to obtain information for analyses, and executing programs to model and predict wildlife-vehicle collision risk. The system also facilitates data collection via remote technology as shown in blue in \Cref{wvc_server}. An online portal or mobile device `app' can enable users to provide information originating from any source (e.g. citizens, private-sector companies, governments). Most importantly, the system can report real-time wildlife-vehicle collision risk, based on model predictions, across geographic space to motorists (shown in gray in \Cref{wvc_server}).

\begin{figure*}[!h]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{interfacing.pdf}

Arrows indicate directions of information flow. Additional collection of collisions data (in blue) is by both citizen scientists (top) and professionals (bottom).}
  \label{wvc_server}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Integration of thesis research with existing and new technology}

In developed nations, technology pervades nearly every aspect of human lives. Every office desk is adorned with a computer and nearly all persons carry a mobile device (mostly smartphones). Mobile device use is also increasing rapidly in emerging economies. We use these tools to access information and to assist us with decision-making. Unbeknownst to a significant portion of the public, models are continuously running and recalibrating on servers throughout the world to deliver information to these devices. Some help to optimise our search results on a web page, whilst others determine efficient transportation routes. This approach to disseminating real-time, model-generated information can be applied to road safety, specifically wildlife-vehicle collisions, to provide decision support for managers or warnings to motorists. I envision my research to be easily extended to either application.

%\subsubsection{Desktop-based decision support tool for managers}
Decision support tools are used by managers in a wide range of fields \citep{shim02}. \Cref{wvc_tool} shows an unpublished web-based interface to the model framework presented in this thesis. Developed as a proof of concept, I wrapped the modelling methods with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows managers to change values of species occurrence, traffic volume, and traffic speed on road segments and simulate expected collision risk across a network. Although this proof of concept is quite rudimentary, it illustrates the potential features that a decision support tool may provide to direct efforts on reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions.

\begin{figure*}[!h]

  \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{shinyapp.png}}
  \caption[Decision support tool for wildlife-vehicle collisions]{Screen capture of web-based interface for a wildlife-vehicle collision risk modelling tool. The tool was originally developed for Bendigo, a medium-sized town in south-east Australia that experiences high numbers of kangaroo-vehicle collisions. Users can select different species and make adjustments to traffic speed or volume to influence predicted collision risk on the road network. The predictions are downloadable as geographic information system (GIS) or raw tabular data for use in other software.}
  \label{wvc_tool}
\end{figure*}

%\subsubsection{Real-time warning `app' for mobile devices}
Changing human behaviour is a difficult task and a large amount of sociological and psychological literature is devoted to it. Studies suggest that one important factor to precipitate human behaviour change is the convenience of attaining outcomes \citep[i.e. least effort hypothesis proposed in human ecology, see][]{zipf49}. Further, technology has also been shown to be persuasive \citep{fogg03,lath13}, and therefore, mobile devices may be an effective media for influencing human behaviour. As such, mobile phones and global-positioning units are ideal candidates for receiving relative collision risk (based on geographic location and time of day) from model predictions and disseminating that information to motorists. The dynamic nature of a warning application may exceed the utility of traditional warning devices, such as signage, which are considered largely ineffective \citep{bond13}.  Smartphone applications that report locations of collisions (and also accept observations) exist and are in use today \citep{aane09}, however, do not utilise modelling mechanisms. In this respect, these applications are simply reporting mechanisms and, thus, may only be slightly more effective than road signs. Modelling risk and reporting it in real-time provides dynamic information to motorists that can be conveyed in understandable terms such as `relative likelihood of collision' rather than dots (representing collisions) aggregated along a road segment.

\section{Concluding remarks}

Human-wildlife interactions, and thus wildlife-vehicle collisions, are a global phenomenon of immense proportion contributing to millions of wildlife deaths annually. Issues such as animal mortality on roads will be exacerbated by future human development as we increase our proximity to wildlife. To address these issues, we need to be strategic about where and when we mitigate. This thesis provided analytical tools for making better decisions about environmental management. It is my hope that the contents of this work will assist others in solving contemporary ecological issues.
