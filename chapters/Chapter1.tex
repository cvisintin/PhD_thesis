\section{The wildlife and roads conundrum}

\subsection{Human-wildlife interactions}

We are now in what some refer to as the \textit{Anthropocene}, where \textit{Homo sapiens} exert strong influences on climatic, geologic and biotic systems \citep{crut06}. Studies estimate that humans have transformed more than seventy-five percent of the earth's ice-free terrestrial surface \citep[e.g.][]{elli08}. These modifications result from large-scale activities; perhaps the most influential being intensified agricultural production, provision of linear infrastructure (e.g. roads, rail, and utility easements), and urban development \citep{vito97,sand02,fole05}. Human population is forecast to grow in the future, and this will increase pressure on unmodified landscapes. For example, recent projections of population indicate a continued increase this century with projections between 9.6 and 12.3 billion in 2100 \citep{gerl14}. The largest rates of increase are projected for developing countries, such as Africa, and these will have environmental consequences such as land transformation. Further, these issues are compounded by the high amounts of biodiversity and low amount of  conservation resources in developing countries. 

As permanent human settlements, industry, and related infrastructure spread over the Earthâ€™s surface, bringing people closer to wildlife, modern human perspectives consider a conceptual distance between humans and the natural world. When this conceptual separation is breached, either intentionally or unintentionally, it results in what is termed `human-wildlife interactions' \citep[see][]{manf08}. In this field of research, all manners of interactions are considered; positive \citep{dall12}, negative \citep{jone99} and neutral. The impacts of wildlife on humans are a product of the frequency, duration, and consequence of the interaction; these relationships can be conceptually plotted (\Cref{hmi_diagram}) to illustrate different examples. Each situation requires different management strategies; for instance, the severity and nature of elephant raids on crops will warrant different mitigation than coyote attacks on domesticated pets. Although many interactions usually have opposite effects on humans and wildlife (i.e. good for humans, bad for wildlife, and vice versa), some human-wildlife interactions may have mutual benefits such as supplemental feeding of wild birds, or mutual negative outcomes such as wildlife-vehicle collisions.

Four examples are: 1) supplemental feeding of birds in backyards; 2) elephant raids on agricultural crops; 3) raccoons feeding from rubbish bins and; 4) wildlife-vehicle collisions with large species}.

\end{figure*}

In places of human settlement, increased exposure to wildlife is due to tolerant species remaining or re-establishing in human-dominated landscapes \citep{soul16}. Although the suite of organisms that humans have contact with is quite varied -- the most frequent contact possibly being with invertebrates -- medium to large species (i.e., $>$10 kg) tend to get more attention, especially when issues arise \citep{seor16}. Certain kinds of interactions, usually where wildlife and humans compete for resources, or intersect in a way that causes nuisance or harm to human activities are referred to as `human-wildlife conflicts' [but see][]\citep{pete10}. Studies have demonstrated notable impacts on society (e.g. human injuries, illness, and economic losses) from wildlife \citep{cono95}. Larger species are more likely to cause significant harm to person or damage to property \citep{cono01} and are less easily managed by individuals that lack proper training. Therefore, the public expectation is of government intervention to manage human-wildlife conflicts \citep{reit99}. Further, the general public often views the management of human-wildlife conflicts to reside in the scope of wildlife-focussed disciplines, however, issues arising from human-wildlife interactions are complex and may require knowledge from several non-ecological fields \citep{deck97,madd04}. For example, specialist knowledge on both animal behaviour (zoology) and human behaviour (sociology) may be combined to arrive at effective solutions \citep{dicka10}.

%People generally appreciate the existence of wildlife within and around their places of settlement \citep{dick86,kell93,raad07}. Bird watching is a popular recreational activity practised worldwide and many communities rely on wildlife tourism as an economic resource \citep{news05}. In urban settings, humans may also consider species that surround them throughout their everyday lives as fellow-creatures \citep{zinn08}.

%From the other perspective, large charismatic species are often persecuted when residing in close proximity to human settlements and therefore targets of conservation programs \citep{trev03}.

%Human beings generally appreciate the existence of wildlife within and around their places of settlement \citep{dick86,kell93,news05,raad07}. Bird watching is a popular recreational activity practised worldwide and many communities rely of wildlife tourism as an economic resource. Further, citizens are excited to learn about some of the more cryptic species that inhabit their immediate environment (Visintin, personal observation -- see \Cref{microbats}). In urban settings, human-wildlife interactions may be considered benign due to human's consideration of species that surround them throughout their everyday lives as fellow-creatures \citep{zinn08}.

%In many cases, wildlife aggression towards humans is due to protection of offspring; for example, swooping Australian magpies \citep{jone99} as shown in \Cref{magpie}.

%\subsection{Effects of the built environment on wildlife}
%
%In contrast to the natural environment, the built environment refers to human-manufactured structures, infrastructure, and recreational landscapes (e.g. urban parks) where people reside and conduct daily activities.  The built environment has mixed effects on wildlife persistence. Some species thrive in urban landscapes (termed `urban adapters') whilst others perish \citep{shoc06}. `Urban adapter' species benefit from increased availability of resources. For example, gulls and other urban birds rely on overflowing rubbish bins for food \citep{ditc06} and bats utilise small cavities in buildings and overpasses for shelter \citep{kunz82}. Many of the urban-adapted species, however, are invasive and displace native wildlife \citep{mcki06}. Built environments can also negatively effect sensitive species through direct displacement from habitat \citep{czec97}, or disturbance due to light and noise pollution \citep{parr16}. Further, wildlife mortality may result from static (e.g. bird strikes to glass) and non-static (e.g. car strikes to wildlife) elements of the built environment. 

\subsection{Impacts of linear infrastructure on wildlife}

Linear infrastructure can traverse vast areas between human settlements, and penetrate remaining natural and semi-natural areas. In some cases, these easements may be the only remaining semi-natural refuges for wildlife \citep{benn91}. Linear infrastructure is most commonly thought of as roads, however, can also include railways, utility easements, and other continuous human-engineered resources in the landscape.

Impacts of linear infrastructure on wildlife can be positive, neutral, or negative. For example, disused road reserves lead to retention of habitat that may benefit wildlife as they often contain old and diverse remnant vegetation \citep{lent11}. Further, linear infrastructure without moving vehicles may provide connection corridors and assist migration for some species \citep{rvdr15}. Effects may be neutral when suitable habitat is provided on road reserves with very little traffic volume or occupied by species with low mobility. Nonetheless, negative effects of linear infrastructure on wildlife persistence may certainly outweigh the benefits.

There are few places left on Earth that are not accessible by some form of road (\Cref{roads}) and, consequently, the vast sphere of ecological influence makes roads a global concern \citep{laur14}. The field of `road ecology' evolved to study problems and solutions associated with the construction and use of roads across the natural landscape \citep[see][]{form03}. It is well documented that roads have negative impacts on wildlife \citep{form98,spel98,rvdr15}, both indirectly and directly. The construction and use of road networks contributes to fragmentation, modification and loss of habitat, generates environmental pollution and facilitates human disturbance to natural landscapes (e.g. clearing, logging, mining, hunting). Roads also have direct impacts on wildlife populations through mortality resulting from wildlife-vehicle collisions \citep{fahr09}.

\subsection{Wildlife mortality on roads}

Human-wildlife conflicts occur where moving vehicles and animals co-occur in space and time, and this is facilitated by transportation networks. Private transport is increasingly common; people travel further and faster. Growth of roads is particularly large in developing nations, which will increase as developing nations become more affluent \citep{rvdr15}. The rate of mortality of wildlife will also increase due to collisions with moving vehicles. It is estimated that billions of fauna die annually due to collisions with vehicles on transportation networks \citep{seil06}. Animals that are struck and die on roadsides or railway corridors attract predators and may result in secondary collisions which further increase mortality rates \citep{spel98}. From a conservation perspective, these mortalities can result in population effects and disruption to food-chain networks \citep{ramp06b,cham10,pola14}.  Although collisions with wildlife bring about matters of animal welfare, biodiversity, and wildlife persistence, perhaps the largest concern to road managers is human safety. 

From an anthropocentric perspective, wildlife-vehicle collisions with larger species cause injuries, property damage, and occasional loss of human life which compels road and wildlife managers to find solutions. Both the visibility of the problem -- resulting in negative public reactions -- and potential threats to human safety have caused some road authorities to regularly patrol problematic roads and collect carcasses. In some cases the data is recorded \citep{huij07a}. This has also initiated partnerships between academics and road authorities to conduct scientific research on animal-vehicle collisions.  These endeavours have created a wealth of research and literature on larger common species \citep{biss08b,clev02,romi96,sudh09}, but proportionally lower amounts on smaller (and perhaps more threatened) fauna \citep{clev03}.

\section{Improving management and decision-making}

\subsection{Understanding wildlife-vehicle collisions}

The factors influencing collision risk are quite broad and can be grouped into four major categories: animal behaviour, human behaviour, the road environment, and the landscape environment \citep{form03}. For example, increases in collisions may be due to the following: animal behaviours, such as migration, flight response, or feeding patterns, thereby increasing species presence on roads; the operation of motor vehicles by humans at high volumes, high speeds, and at dangerous times; landscape features attracting animals to, and influencing movement across, roads and; road features hindering safe vehicle operation. In seventy-one studies that analysed wildlife-vehicle collision risk, traffic related variables (volume and speed) -- which may be considered human behaviour -- featured in the top four most commonly used predictor variables (\Cref{wvc_studies}). See \Cref{apx:D} for all variables and studies used in the analysis.

\begin{figure*}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{wvc_studies.png}
  \caption[Variables used in wildlife-vehicle collision studies]{Common variables used in wildlife-vehicle collision studies. The dots show the frequency each modelling variable was used in a total of seventy-one studies on wildlife-vehicle collisions.}
  \label{wvc_studies}
\end{figure*}

%Worldwide, many studies have been undertaken to better understand wildlife-vehicle collisions in an effort to supplement management.  Some studies related collisions to animal biology, behaviour and characteristics. In Australia, \cite{coul97} showed a male bias across several species of macropod roadkills, whilst \cite{kloc06} determined a female bias in red kangaroos.  \cite{lee04} concluded that kangaroo density near roads increased during periods of drought due to relative greenness of vegetation at road verges. \cite{ramp06b} used collision events in a population viability analysis model to evaluate effects on swamp wallabies.  In North America, animal travel speed was related to collisions \citep{litv08}. Research has also demonstrated that collision occurrence is related to many other combinations of environmental and anthropogenic variables \citep{barn07}.

Collision occurrence is related to many combinations of environmental and anthropogenic variables \citep{barn07}. Some of these factors are more easily managed than others and that presents an optimisation problem for managers; where to have the largest effect depends on knowing the relative influence of each factor on collision risk. In some cases the conflicts can be mitigated with engineering solutions, such as tunnels and land bridges \citep{bond08}, or rope ladders \citep{soan13}, but these are more suited to known species movements or behaviours. Where mobile wildlife are in contact diffusely over a road network it is a more difficult problem to manage. In this case mitigation can either focus on excluding or discouraging wildlife from roads or changing human behaviour.

Mitigation strategies to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions have varying costs and effectiveness \citep{huij09} and costs can be compounded by additional collisions occurring from ineffective mitigation. Fencing is very effective at excluding animals from roads and reducing WVC, however, can result in other negative impacts to wildlife such as limitation of dispersal \citep[i.e. barrier effects, see][]{jaeg04}. Fences are often used in conjunction with crossing structures to facilitate connectivity whilst reducing collisions but these installations can be prohibitively expensive. Discouragement devices to scare animals off of roads are much less expensive but have marginal effectiveness \citep{bend03,sche03}. Influencing human behaviour is perhaps the least expensive form of mitigation yet difficult to implement effectively. Road signage is the most common form, however, is predominantly ineffective as humans become easily conditioned to warning messages \citep{bond13}. In addition to knowing \textit{how} to mitigate, an important objective in managing wildlife-vehicle collisions is also knowing \textit{where} and \textit{when} to intervene.

Temporal variation occurs in both natural and anthropogenic systems. Wildlife species have different patterns of activities (e.g. diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular) that make them more or less susceptible to wildlife-vehicle collisions during the day. When predictions of collision risk are made using temporal information, they are referred to as `hot moments'. In the few studies that represent temporal variation at the hourly scale \citep[e.g.][]{neum12}, the models do not consider changing patterns of daylight throughout the year -- which often influences wildlife activity. For example, using hour as a predictor will have considerable error when species do not have consistent daily patterns of movement throughout the year.

%may include (in order of increasing costs), road signage \citep{bond13}, discouragement and/or detection devices \citep{huij03,huij06}, fencing installations \citep{clev02,jaeg04}, road crossing structures (overpasses and underpasses) , or a combination of treatments \citep{dani98,pola14,romi96}. 

%One difficulty is the implementation and/or translation of scientific research and problem-solving into management actions \citep{roux06}.  The disconnects between environmental research, conservation policy and management/implementation are extensively referred to in the ecological literature.  Technology, most notably electronic media and computers, has been used to overcome some of these problems and functions as a tool to bridge the information divide.  Software applications to inform management decisions have been developed in areas of broad landscape and seascape conservation \citep{ball09,watt09}, species distributions \citep{phil06}, climate change \citep{east09}, water resources \citep{liu08}, and many others.  Moreover, the translation of scientific research into accessible public knowledge and education is also a formidable problem \citep{lubc98}.  This is an area that deserves more attention as human behaviour change can be a powerful upstream solution to complement collision management efforts.

\subsection{Incorporating risk theory \& modelling}

Preventing wildlife-vehicle collision may be viewed as a risk analysis problem. Risks are chances of adverse events, that have defined consequences, happening in specified time frames \citep{burg05}. Managing risks involves a) assessing hazards (i.e. potentially harmful situations), exposure to hazards, and probabilities of hazards occurring, b) simulating outcomes under different scenarios, and c) making decisions based on acceptable thresholds. To assess risk, it is useful to employ quantitative methods either independently or in combination with qualitative methods. Quantitative analysis is used to understand, communicate, and manage uncertainty about risk in many fields such as engineering \citep{apos04}, biological sciences \citep{sute16}, and finance \citep{mcne15}.  All of these fields define risk a bit differently and the parameterisations used in their analyses vary accordingly.

%\subsection{Spatial statistics and modelling}
Many studies have utilised environmental modelling to analyse and predict risks to species (fauna and flora) and biotic systems resulting from human activity. The outputs of these models have many benefits including informing management operations, supplementing additional models, facilitating scientific research, and optimising mitigation strategies. The use of modelling in conservation efforts is well established \citep{star86}, however, predicting risks to wildlife by vehicles is a relatively new practice. The most common use of modelling has been to identify collision `hotspots' in geographic space in an effort to direct management efforts. For example, \cite{malo04} predicted collision risk along a 4-lane highway in Spain for multiple species at two spatial scales using logistic regression. Similar methods have been used to predict collision risk with wombats \citep{roge09}, and deer \citep{sudh09}.

Whilst the predictions from such models may be useful to managers, a comparative framework that describes simple relationships between variables, with tunable parts, and allows simulation of outcomes is more useful. First, it can identify simple predictors for collision risk that are able to be mitigated, such as traffic volume. This also allows sensitivity analyses on proposed management scenarios to be conducted. Further, although management implications are highlighted in many studies, it is not always clear how the results of the analyses could be easily applied due to variable interactions and confounding effects in the model predictors \citep{guns11}. Some studies explicitly suggest mitigation that relates directly to environmental variables based on model results \citep[see][]{gril09}.  Although these recommendations are useful in the specific contexts of the studies, they may not generalise to varying spatial scales -- specifically large areas. In response to these shortcomings, road ecology needs a general framework to combine the disparate factors relating to wildlife-vehicle collisions \citep{clev15} and better support management objectives, globally.
%
%When undertaking statistical modelling of events, such as collisions, it is common to analyse either binary data (occurred/did not occur) or count data (how many occurred).  As it is not plausible to have negative or partial events, these data are always constrained to be zero or positive integers. Bernoulli and Poisson distributions both satisfy these requirements and, thus, are often chosen for modelling collision events. A common statistical model used for collisions is based on generalised linear regression \citep{mccu89}; a robust and widely-used statistical method in which non-continuous (discrete) responses are regressed on a linear predictor using a link function. Spatial statistics is an extension of these methods and studies geographic properties of objects or events; in two-dimensional space, the choice of link function must be deliberate \citep{badd10}. Related to this concept, patterns of events can be analysed using point process models which consider events occurring across space with a single rate parameter. Modelling events on linear networks is a special case of one-dimensional point process analysis that assumes collisions occurring outside the network are impossible \citep{okab09} -- collisions will always occur coincident with the movement vectors of vehicles. One advantage of using Poisson point processes is that they assume collision events occur over a domain bound by time and are not influenced by the choice of sampling area or spatial scale. Yet, these sorts of models are not regularly used in road ecology studies.

\subsection{The challenges of disparate data}
%
The contemporary modeller has considerable access to publicly-available data. Anthropogenic data, such as demography, exist for most developed parts of the world. Environmental data, particularly satellite-based and remotely-sensed, have global coverage. Collecting data can be quite expensive, and this information provides low-cost sources of information and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of modelling wildlife-vehicle collisions. Further, citizen-science data can supplement data-deficient studies, however, the use of this data in collision modelling, relative to the amount in existence, is quite low \citep[but see][]{paul14}. Worldwide, collision data is collected by non-government organisations, private-sector entities (e.g. insurance companies), academic institutions, government agencies (e.g. road authorities and environmental managers), community groups, and individual citizen scientists but these data are not always easily attainable due to privacy restrictions or data formats. 

Consequently, many studies that use predictive modelling to determine where and when WVC will occur are limited to single sources of data -- either field collected based on predetermined project requirements \citep[e.g.][]{lang09,roge09} or pre-existing from independent surveys or routine collections \citep[e.g.][]{hoth12,malo04}. Bias and error may arise from the data sources and collection methods, however, these are not often explicitly reported or accounted for in the modelling methods. Further, few studies utilise independently-obtained data to validate model performance. Although cataloguing and reporting systems are used to store data on WVC, few are open access or incorporate data from other institutions or previous surveying events \citep[but see][]{shil15b}. As disparate sources of collision data are combined, management will require an analytic modelling tool that is flexible to these data and can explicitly handle associated biases and errors.

%However, data has inherent uncertainties and biases \citep{glym97}; uncertainty may result from measurement error, under-reporting, and general environmental stochasticity whilst bias is often due to selective sampling (either intentional or unintentional). Considering these shortcomings, data should always include metadata that reports these deficiencies so modellers may adequately address them in analyses. Many online datasets, derived by scientific organisations and often post-processed, include metadata about uncertainties.
%
%Citizen-science data can supplement data-deficient ecological studies, and whilst shown to be effective in road ecology \citep{paul14}, is rarely used in the discipline. The use of such data, however, should be subject to rigorous quality control and verification which may, or may not, be supplemented by adequate metadata. Records may not be useful due to incomplete/incorrect data or geographical ambiguity. Although under-reporting of data has limited effects on model robustness, spatial biases can adversely affect model performance \citep{snow15}. In particular, survey efforts are seldom reported in collision data and vary considerably amongst and within jurisdictions \citep{huij07a}.
%
%It is important to identify and address spatial biases when developing predictive models. Models trained on observations that are spatially biased (e.g. collected at particular places or dependent on characteristics of reporting individuals) may cause model predictions to reflect patterns of collection rather than actual distributions of organisms or events. Methods have been developed to address bias in models fit to both presence-absence \citep{hijm12} and presence-only data \citep{kram13}. For both types, implicit biases in data may be incorporated into modelling if they are adequately described in metadata \citep{wart13}. For example, many of the records in fauna atlases are subject to geographical bias (e.g. close to roads and towns), and this is also prevalent in collision or carcass data.
%%\subsection{Temporal variation in data}
%
%To address some of this uncertainty, studies may represent temporal data as a categorical variable \citep{mizu14} with discrete ranges \citep{rowd08}. As a continuous variable, hour may be represented by cyclic functions in predictive models \citep{neum12,thur15}.

%\subsection{Reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions}

\section{Thesis aims and scope}

It is clear that wildlife-vehicle collisions are a complex problem that have global implications. This problem will continue into the future as more developing nations expand their linear transportation networks thereby bringing humans and wildlife into closer proximity. Effective management will require knowing where, when, and how to mitigate collision risks, but this will require a clear understanding of the factors, and their interactions, relating to wildlife-vehicle collisions. Previous work on modelling and predicting collision risk have been contextually useful but their generality or relationship to management objectives were not explored. There is a critical need for a conceptual risk framework for modelling and predicting wildlife-vehicle collisions that is flexible to different parameterisations, informative for management objectives, generalisable to different spatial scales and transportation networks, and responsive to temporal information. These features will support global efforts to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.

My aim is to introduce a conceptual model framework to analyse and predict where and when wildlife will be at high risk of collisions with moving vehicles across large transportation networks and irrespective of species or geographic area. As I intend the work to support managers working in the wildlife and transportation fields, I develop analyses that are generalisable, transferable, reproducible, and based on open-source data and methods. In each chapter, I test different model applications and demonstrates management value. I introduce a general conceptual framework to model wildlife-vehicle collision risk using tunable sub-models and publicly-accessible data in \Cref{sec:egk}. Using the same geographic area, in \Cref{sec:6sp} I test the ability of the conceptual model framework to generalise to six mammal species commonly involved in wildlife-vehicle collisions. In \Cref{sec:cal}, I apply the conceptual framework to a different geographic area (California, USA) and a different species (Mule deer) to test its flexibility to varying locations and spatial scales. In addition to road vehicles, trains also hit wildlife but collision risk on railways is seldom studied. I test the conceptual model's ability to generalise to other transportation networks and analyse and predict wildlife-train collisions in both space and time in \Cref{sec:train}. To assess the performance of the model introduced in \Cref{sec:egk}, and demonstrate the importance of unified and standardised data repositories of wildlife-vehicle collisions, I compare model predictions to additional datasets collected by various organisations in \Cref{sec:val}. In \Cref{sec:conc}, I summarise a selection of key findings within the chapters whilst suggesting novel areas for further research and potential applications of the work.
