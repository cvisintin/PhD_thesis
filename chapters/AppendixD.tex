\section{Ecology and Evolution}

\Cref{sec:egk} was published during PhD candidature and the content in the chapter is nearly identical to the journal article with the following exceptions: (a) supporting information listed in the publication has been included within the thesis chapter for completeness (resulting in shifting figure numbers), and (b) R scripts used for analysis have been included in \Cref{apx:A} for the reader's information.
